<h1>Stratospheric Chemistry and Arctic Ozone Decline</h1>
<h2>Part 2.3 from <span class="sci_title">ACE: An Overview</span> by Dr. Peter Bernath</h2>
<p class="text">
	The anthropogenic release of CFCs affects the stratospheric ozone layer through gas phase 
	chemical reactions (such as the Cl/ClO cycle) as well as by heterogeneous chemistry on 
	PSCs and aerosols [<a href="#ref">1</a>]. CFCs, transported to the stratosphere, are 
	broken down largely by UV light and release &quot;active&quot; chlorine species such as Cl and ClO. 
	These species destroy odd oxygen (O + O<sub>3</sub>) via various gas phase catalytic 
	cycles. However, the full extent of the destruction is ameliorated by the storage of the 
	active chlorine in the reservoir species HCl and ClONO<sub>2</sub>, neither of which 
	reacts efficiently with O<sub>3</sub> or O. If only the gas phase 
	chemical reactions are considered then the predicted effect on the total ozone column is 
	relatively small. For example, Brasseur [<a href="#ref">7</a>] predicts with a 2D model 
	(latitude-elevation) that the ozone column would decrease by less than 1% over the 
	ten-year period 1980-1990 in the absence of heterogeneous chemistry.
</p>
<p class="text">
	The discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole in 1985 by Farman et al. [<a href="#ref">6</a>] 
	led to the realization that heterogeneous reactions were important in determining the ozone 
	budget in polar regions. Later work [<a href="#ref">8</a>] indicated that heterogeneous 
	reactions on and within sulphate aerosols also play an important role in the stratosphere. 
	Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> from &quot;random&quot; eruptions penetrating the stratosphere is also 
	important in maintaining the stratospheric sulphate layer budget. Each winter the vortex 
	forms in the polar regions due to the IR cooling that occurs causing temperatures to drop 
	well below 200 K. The Antarctic vortex is colder than the Arctic vortex. With these cold 
	temperatures H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and various mixtures can 
	freeze or exist as supercooled solutions. As the temperature drops below 195 K, large 
	amounts of HNO<sub>3</sub> can dissolve into the sulphate aerosols to form ternary 
	solutions, amounts large enough to deplete almost entirely the gas phase HNO<sub>3</sub> 
	levels. The volume of these aerosol solutions can dramatically increase with this large 
	uptake of gaseous HNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. It is thought that these super-cooled 
	ternary H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/HNO<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O liquid solutions can 
	exist to within a few degrees of the frost point without forming type I PSC NAT (solid 
	HNO<sub>3</sub>&middot;3H<sub>2</sub>O) and SAT 
	(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&middot;4H<sub>2</sub>O). If the temperature falls below the 
	ice frost point (~188 K), type II PSC water ice can form. As temperatures again rise, 
	adsorption of gas phase HNO<sub>3</sub> onto solid SAT can help to regenerate ternary 
	solutions and melt SAT far below the temperature (210-215 K) SAT is believed to melt 
	[<a href="#ref">9</a>, <a href="#ref">10</a>]. Due to the low temperatures needed for solid 
	PSCs to form, it is expected that processing on liquid surfaces is more important in the 
	Arctic than the Antarctic.
</p>
<p class="text">
	Heterogeneous reactions on these condensed phases can activate chlorine and bromine while 
	tying up odd-nitrogen as HNO<sub>3</sub>(a) [<a href="#ref">11</a>]. The active chlorine 
	and to a lesser extent bromine drive the reactions that form the ozone hole. For example, 
	on the ice crystals, inactive or reservoir forms of the halogen catalysts are freed,
</p>
<p class="text">
	ClONO<sub>2</sub> + HX (ice) --&gt; HNO<sub>3</sub> (ice) + XCl 
	<br>
	(where X = Cl, Br).
</p>
<p class="text">
	Low temperatures drive these processes. As the polar lower stratospheric temperatures drop 
	at the end of the fall season, the aerosol reactions become important. For example, the 
	solubility of HCl is very temperature sensitive and as the temperature drops, it begins to 
	dissolve in the ternary solution / sulphate aerosol. These and similar reactions drive the 
	formation of the ozone hole in the polar late winter (Northern Hemisphere) and austral 
	springtime. These reactions can occur during the nighttime and when polar sunrise occurs: 
	species such as Cl<sub>2</sub>, BrCl and ClNO<sub>2</sub> are readily photolysed into more 
	labile species such as Cl. The processed air can persist for several weeks since the 
	reformation of the reservoir species HCl and ClNO<sub>3</sub> is a relatively slow process 
	at polar latitudes. Gravitational sedimentation of the PSCs removes stratospheric 
	HNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O (denitrification and dehydration). One of the main 
	features of ozone loss in polar regions is that it is not rate-limited by the low abundance 
	of atomic oxygen. One of the main loss mechanisms involves self-reaction of ClO:
</p>
<p class="text">
	ClO + ClO --&gt; Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><br>
	Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + hv --&gt; Cl + ClO<sub>2</sub><br>
	ClO<sub>2</sub> + M --&gt; Cl + O<sub>2</sub><br>
	2(Cl + O<sub>3</sub> --&gt; ClO + O<sub>2</sub>)<br>
	-------------------------------<br>
  O<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> --&gt; 3O<sub>2</sub> (net)
</p>
<p class="text">
	As long as temperatures are less than ~210 K, then thermal decomposition of 
	Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><br>
	Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + M --&gt; ClO + ClO, <br>
	which does not lead to ozone loss, does not play a major role. Another important ozone loss 
	mechanism is due to the synergistic reaction between BrO and ClO [<a href="#ref">13</a>]:<br><br>
	BrO + ClO --&gt; Br + Cl + O<sub>2</sub><br>
	BrO + ClO --&gt; BrCl + O<sub>2</sub> <br>
	BrCl + hv --&gt; Br + Cl<br>
	Cl + O<sub>3</sub> --&gt; ClO + O<sub>2</sub><br>
	Br + O<sub>3</sub> --&gt; BrO + O<sub>2 </sub><br><br>
	As before, this loss rate is not limited by the abundance of atomic oxygen.
</p>
<p class="text">
	The inclusion of heterogeneous reactions appears to be able to account for the severe ozone 
	loss in the Antarctic spring [<a href="#ref">1</a>]. There have been problems accounting for 
	the ozone decline in the Arctic [<a href="#ref">15</a>] although recent modelling work by 
	Lefevre et al. [<a href="#ref">5</a>] using a chemical transport model produces quite good 
	agreement with column ozone measurements. Springtime ozone depletion differs between the 
	Arctic and Antarctic due to differences in seasonal temperature extremes largely caused by 
	atmospheric dynamics related to topography. The northern polar vortex is somewhat larger in 
	extent, less well defined spatially, and more unstable than the southern vortex. More of the 
	northern vortex is exposed to sunlight during the boreal winter, increasing the complexity of 
	both its chemistry and physics. Another effect that may be important is processing that occurs 
	at mesoscales (&lt; 50 km). Most model simulations to date are run at rather low resolution. 
	High-resolution (mesoscale) model runs by Carslaw et al. [<a href="#ref">16</a>] suggest that 
	temperatures sufficiently low for PSCs to form can be induced by mountain waves even when the 
	synoptic temperatures appear to be too high for the formation of PSCs. And as noted above the 
	air, once processed, they will remain processed for several weeks. In this manner large volumes 
	of stratospheric air may undergo processing.

<p class="text">
	There is no dramatic &quot;Arctic ozone hole&quot; in the spring because downward transport of ozone-rich 
	air masks the strong ozone depletion [<a href="#ref">3</a> to <a href="#ref">5</a>]. Additionally, 
	Arctic stratospheric temperatures are generally warmer than those in the Antarctic because the 
	vortex is often in sunlight. The PSCs associated with strong ozone depletion in the springtime 
	form in the stratosphere at temperatures below about 195 K (see 
	<span class="sci_italic">Figure 4</span>). Such temperatures are common in the Antarctic winter 
	but are rarer in the Arctic. Typical Arctic winter temperatures lie just above 195 K so that 
	there is a strong correlation between springtime Arctic ozone loss and the formation of PSCs. 
	Salawitch has noted the correlation between Arctic ozone column and the minimum temperature 
	measured in March at 50 mbar (about 20 km) (see <span class="sci_italic">Figure 4 </span>). 
	When this temperature dropped below 195 K as it did in 1994, 1995 and 1997, strong ozone loss 
	was detected. The spring of 1998, however, was relatively warm (198 K) and the ozone loss was 
	much reduced. These observations make a strong case for the importance of heterogeneous PSC 
	chemistry in Arctic ozone declines. In addition to gases, ACE will thus strongly focus on the 
	chemistry and physics of PSC particles. Note that the ozone declines at mid-latitudes cannot be 
	attributed to the polar chemistry, although transport of ozone-depleted air might be a 
	contributory factor.
