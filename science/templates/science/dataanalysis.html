		<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
		<p class="text">
			The raw SCISAT data is downlinked to ground stations in Saskatoon, St. Hubert, 
			Alaska and Kiruna. The data volume, which at times can exceed 3 Gb per 
			day, is transferred to the Mission Operations Centre operated by 
			Canadian Space Agency in St. Hubert (near Montreal) then sent to the 
			Science Operations Centre at the University of Waterloo. At Waterloo 
			the data is archived and processed to obtain 
                        <a href="../sfmdata/scisatdata.html"> data products</a> 
			for distribution to the science team members.

			Atmospheric temperature profiles are determined as a function of pressure 
			by starting with a priori data from an upper atmospheric model combined with 
			meteorological data from the Canadian Meteorological Centre for improved 
			accuracy in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. An empirically determined 
			CO<sub>2</sub> volume mixing ratio is used for the ACE-FTS 
			and O<sub>2</sub> A-, B- and Gamma-bands for MAESTRO. Both ACE-FTS and MAESTRO 
			<a href="http://databace.scisat.ca/occultation_tool.php">solar occultation</a>
			measurements are converted to height profiles of atmospheric species. The 
			ACE-FTS algorithm for retrieval of atmospheric profiles has some similarities 
			to the ATMOS algorithms but applies a more sophisticated global fit approach, 
			developed by and described in detail by 
			<a href="http://www.ace.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2005/Boone-retrievals2005reprint.pdf">Boone et al. [2005]</a>. The 
			MAESTRO algorithms draw on previous work by McElroy and co-workers with a 
			variety of UV/visible spectrographs that have been deployed.
