32	Bernath2001	Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE): An Overview	P. Bernath	2001	1		Spectroscopy from Space	Springer Netherlands		\N	\N	147-161			http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-0832-7_9		publications/pdfs/PBChapterACE.pdf			10.1007/978-94-010-0832-7_9	f	ACE is a Canadian satellite mission that will measure and help to understand the chemical and dynamical processes that control the distribution of ozone in the stratosphere. The ACE instruments are a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, a UV/visible/near IR spectrograph and a two channel solar imager, all working in solar occultation mode.	978-94-010-0832-7	5

Chernov	2012	5	A&A				541	\N	A125			https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201218867		publications/pdfs/K-IR-2012.pdf			10.1051/0004-6361/201218867	f	Context. The infrared (IR) range is becoming increasingly important to astronomical studies of cool or dust-obscured objects, such as dwarfs, disks, or planets, and in the extended atmospheres of evolved stars. A general drawback of the IR spectral region is the much lower number of atomic lines available (relative to the visible and ultraviolet ranges).\r\nAims. We attempt to obtain new laboratory spectra to help us identify spectral lines in the IR. This may result in the discovery of new excited atomic levels that are difficult to compute theoretically with high accuracy, hence can be determined solely from IR lines.\r\nMethods. The K vapor was formed through the ablation of the KI (potassium iodide) target by a high-repetition-rate (1.0 kHz) pulsed nanosecond ArF laser (λ = 193 nm, output energy of 15 mJ) in a vacuum (10-2 Torr). The time-resolved emission spectrum of the neutral atomic potassium (K i) was recorded in the 700–7000 cm-1 region using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technique with a resolution of 0.02 cm-1. The f-values calculated in the quantum-defect theory approximation are presented for the transitions involving the reported K i levels.\r\nResults. Precision laboratory measurements are presented for 38 K i lines in the infrared (including 25 lines not measured previously in the laboratory) range using time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The 6g, 6h, and 7h levels of K i are observed for the first time, in addition to updated energy values of the other 23 K i levels and the f-values for the transitions involving these levels.\r\nConclusions. The recorded wave numbers are in good agreement with the data from the available solar spectrum atlases. Nevertheless, we correct their identification for three lines (1343.699, 1548.559, and 1556.986 cm-1).		1

A good agreement is found for ozone, mostly better than 10% between 15 and 45 km. Also, there is no evidence for a systematic altitude registration error in the ACE-FTS profiles. A considerable ACE-FTS negative bias (50–100%) is found however for the nitrogen dioxide data that cannot be explained by the use of a local photochemical model.		1

Proton fluxes were greatly increased during these several days and led to the production of HOx (H, OH, HO2) and NOx (N, NO, NO2), which then caused the destruction of ozone. We focus on the Northern polar region, where satellite measurements and simulations with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM3) showed large enhancements in mesospheric HOx and NOx constituents, and associated ozone reductions, due to these solar proton events (SPEs). The WACCM3 simulations show enhanced short-lived OH and HO2 concentrations throughout the mesosphere in the 60–82.5° N latitude band due to the SPEs for most days in the 16–21 January 2005 period, somewhat higher in abundance than those observed by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). These HOx enhancements led to huge predicted and MLS-measured ozone decreases of greater than 40 % throughout most of the northern polar mesosphere during the SPE period. Envisat Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) measurements of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) show increases throughout the stratosphere with highest enhancements of about 60 pptv in the lowermost mesosphere over the 16–18 January 2005 period due to the solar protons. WACCM3 predictions indicate H2O2 enhancements over the same time period of about three times that amount. Measurements of nitric acid (HNO3) by both MLS and MIPAS show an increase of about 1 ppbv above background levels in the upper stratosphere during 16–29 January 2005. WACCM3 simulations show only minuscule HNO3 increases (<0.05 ppbv) in the upper stratosphere during this time period. Polar mesospheric enhancements of NOx are computed to be greater than 50 ppbv during the SPE period due to the small loss rates during winter. Computed NOx increases, which were statistically significant at the 95 % level, lasted about a month past the SPEs. The SCISAT-1 Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer NOx measurements and MIPAS NO2 measurements for the polar Northern Hemisphere are in reasonable agreement with these predictions. An extremely large ground level enhancement (GLE) occurred during the SPE period on 20 January 2005. We find that protons of energies 300 to 20 000 MeV, associated with this GLE, led to very small enhanced lower stratospheric odd nitrogen concentrations of less than 0.1 % and ozone decreases of less than 0.01 %.		1

Mixing ratios of NO exceeded 1.3 ppmv (10−6 parts per million by volume) during mid-February and are higher than any values previously reported in the Arctic during late winter and early spring. The elevated NOx (NO + NO2) mixing ratios likely resulted from particle emissions by intense solar flares that occurred the previous October and November followed by NOx production and downward transport to the upper stratospheric vortex where the elevated levels persisted due to the long lifetime of NOx during darkness in polar winter and early spring. The descent and the NOx decrease rates in the upper stratospheric vortex are estimated from an analysis of the time series. The measured descent rate is compared with previous observations and model predictions.		1

Most convective parameterizations are tested against temperature and relative humidity profiles from radiosondes. Chemical tracers provide important additional constraints on the vertical redistribution of mass by convective parameterizations. We compile tropical climatologies of water vapor (H2O), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric acid (HNO3) from a variety of satellite, aircraft, and balloon-based measurement platforms. These climatologies are compared with the profiles predicted by a variant of the Emanuel convective parameterization, a two-column model of the tropical atmosphere, and by the implementations of the Relaxed Arakawa Schubert (RAS) and Zhang and McFarlane (ZM) parameterizations in a three-dimensional global forecast model. In general, the models with more pronounced convective outflow in the upper troposphere compare more favorably with observations. These models are associated with increased evaporative moistening in the middle and lower troposphere.		1

However, the current observed rate of this decrease is known to be slower than expected based on reported CCl4 emissions and its estimated overall atmospheric lifetime. Here we use a three-dimensional (3-D) chemical transport model to investigate the impact on its predicted decay of uncertainties in the rates at which CCl4 is removed from the atmosphere by photolysis, by ocean uptake and by degradation in soils. The largest sink is atmospheric photolysis (74 % of total), but a reported 10 % uncertainty in its combined photolysis cross section and quantum yield has only a modest impact on the modelled rate of CCl4 decay. This is partly due to the limiting effect of the rate of transport of CCl4 from the main tropospheric reservoir to the stratosphere, where photolytic loss occurs. The model suggests large interannual variability in the magnitude of this stratospheric photolysis sink caused by variations in transport. The impact of uncertainty in the minor soil sink (9 % of total) is also relatively small. In contrast, the model shows that uncertainty in ocean loss (17 % of total) has the largest impact on modelled CCl4 decay due to its sizeable contribution to CCl4 loss and large lifetime uncertainty range (147 to 241 years). With an assumed CCl4 emission rate of 39 Gg year−1, the reference simulation with the best estimate of loss processes still underestimates the observed CCl4 (overestimates the decay) over the past 2 decades but to a smaller extent than previous studies. Changes to the rate of CCl4 loss processes, in line with known uncertainties, could bring the model into agreement with in situ surface and remote-sensing measurements, as could an increase in emissions to around 47 Gg year−1. Further progress in constraining the CCl4 budget is partly limited by systematic biases between observational datasets. For example, surface observations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) network are larger than from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network but have shown a steeper decreasing trend over the past 2 decades. These differences imply a difference in emissions which is significant relative to uncertainties in the magnitudes of the CCl4 sinks.		1

The ACE instruments are an infrared Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS), a UV/visible/near IR spectrograph and a two-channel solar imager, all working in solar occultation mode. The high-resolution (0.02 cm−1) FTS is the primary instrument on the satellite, and it covers the mid-infrared spectral region (750–4400 cm−1).		1

A rigorous analysis approach would explicitly account for correlations induced in the covariance matrix by apodization, but these correlations are often ignored to simplify and speed up the processing. Using spectra measured by the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy missions, we investigated the effect of apodization on the retrieval of volume mixing ratio profiles for the case in which these correlations are ignored. Minor discrepancies occur between results for apodized and unapodized spectra, particularly when lines with a low signal-to-noise ratio are fitted. A set of microwindows is reported for O3 in the range of 1550--3350 cm-1.		1

Compared with the visible and ultraviolet ranges, fewer atomic and ionic lines are available in the infrared spectral region. Atlases of stellar spectra often provide only a short list of identified lines, and modern laboratory-based spectral features for wavelengths longer than 1 micron are not available for most elements. For the efficient use of the growing capabilities of infrared (IR) astronomy, detailed spectroscopical information on atomic line features in the IR region is needed.\r\nAims. Parts of the infrared stellar (e.g., solar) spectra in the 1200–1800 cm-1 (5.6–8 μm) range have never been observed from the ground because of heavy contamination of the spectrum by telluric absorption lines. Such an infrared spectrum represents a great challenge for laboratory observations of new, unknown infrared atomic transitions involving the atomic levels with high orbital momentum and their comparison with the available spectra.\r\nMethods. The vapors of excited Na i atoms are produced during the ablation of the salt (sodium iodide, Na i) targets by a high-repetition rate (1.0 kHz) pulsed nanosecond ArF laser ExciStar S-Industrial V2.0 1000, pulse length 12 ns, λ = 193 nm, output energy of 15 mJ, fluence about 2–20 J/cm2 inside a vacuum chamber (average pressure 10-2 Torr). The time-resolved emission spectrum of the neutral atomic potassium (Na i) was recorded in the 700–7000 cm-1 region using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technique with a resolution of 0.02 cm-1. The f-values calculated in the quantum-defect theory approximation are presented for the transitions involving the reported Na i levels.\r\nResults. This study reports precision laboratory measurements for 26 Na i lines in the range of 700–7000 cm-1 (14–1.4 μm), including 20 lines not measured previously in the laboratory. This results in newly observed 7h, 6h, and 6g levels, and improved energy determination for ten previously known levels. The doublet structure of the 4f level has been observed for the first time. For transitions between the observed levels, we report calculated f-values that agree reasonably well with experiment.\r\nConclusions. The recorded Na i line features agree with the data from the available solar spectrum atlases. The energy values of Na i 4s, 4p, 5p, 6p, 4f, 5f, and 5g levels extracted from our spectra have lower uncertainties as compared to the values reported several decades ago, but the latter values slightly differ from ours.		1

The data used here were selected from occultations spanning February to April 2004 from 0 to 79.8°N. The midlatitude volume mixing ratio (VMR) of potential water is determined as [H2O] + 2[CH4] and from [H2O] versus [CH4] correlations, then used to calculate the VMR of water vapor entering the stratosphere. We obtain 7.14 ± 0.23 ppm for potential water and 3.65 ± 0.29 ppm for water entering the stratosphere in 2004 for direct comparison with Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) data (1985–1994). We find a very small change in potential water and no change in water entering the stratosphere relative to the 1994 ATMOS data, indicating that increases observed by ATMOS and other instruments from that time period have not continued. This halt in stratospheric water vapor increases is consistent with recent water vapor measurements by other instruments.		1

Vertically-resolved CO concentration profiles are retrieved, extending from the mid-troposphere to the thermosphere (from about 5 to 110 km). We have analyzed the latitudinal variability of the measurements, from which various physical and chemical atmospheric processes are highlighted for further study.		1

We find that there is excellent agreement between the two instruments at the locations investigated over 4 orders of magnitude from the lower stratosphere to the lower thermosphere. There is also good agreement with the CMAM model simulation from 20 km to 90 km in sub-tropical and tropical latitudes but poorer agreement in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere in winter polar regions. For the Arctic in March 2004 this can be attributed, at least partly, to the unique dynamical processes in the stratosphere in the winter of 2003–2004. Clearly CO measurements from these instruments will provide a useful tool for testing model transport from the troposphere to the thermosphere.		1

An intercomparison of these measurements was used to verify the consistency between the HITRAN 2004 3.4-μm band strengths and the strengths of three different visible cross section data sets. These measurements should be of interest to the remote-sensing community, since NO2 measurements obtained by infrared-range instruments are often compared to those obtained by visible-range instruments without accurate knowledge of the consistency between the visible and infrared absorption coefficients. Two significant results were obtained in this study:  (1) A 0.5% agreement was found between the HITRAN 2004 line strengths and the Vandaele et al. (Vandaele, A.

A simple model, driven by cloud free radiative mass fluxes, is used to investigate the origin of these seasonal cycles. The seasonal cycle in O3 is due to seasonal changes in upwelling and high altitude convective outflow. The seasonal cycle in CO at 100 hPa is influenced by both seasonal changes in dynamics and seasonal changes in CO at lower altitudes. The age of air at 17 km varies from 40 days during NH winter to 70 days during NH summer. The seasonal cycle in clear sky radiative heating at the tropical tropopause is mainly due to seasonal cycles in O3 and temperature. The seasonal cycle in O3 can be expected to amplify the seasonal cycle in cold point temperature.		1

Elevated levels of methanol at 0–45° S from 30 September to 3 November 2004 have been measured by the high resolution infrared spectrometer ACE-FTS onboard the SCISAT satellite. Methanol volume mixing ratios higher than 4000 pptv are detected and are strongly correlated with other fire products such as CO, C2H6, and HCN. A sensitivity study of the methanol retrieval, accounting for random and systematic contributions, shows that the retrieved methanol profile is reliable from 8.5 to 16.5 km, with an accuracy of about 20% for measurements inside polluted air masses. The upper tropospheric enhancement ratio of methanol with respect to CO is estimated from the correlation plot between methanol and CO for aged tropical biomass burning plumes. This ratio is in good agreement with the ratio measured in the free troposphere (up to 12 km) by recent aircraft studies and does not suggest any secondary production of methanol by oxidation in aged biomass burning plumes.		1

NOx mixing ratios in the upper stratosphere were 3–6 times larger than observed previously in either the Arctic or Antarctic, aside from the extraordinary winter of 2003–2004. There was only minimal geomagnetic activity in late 2005 and early 2006, however, suggesting that NOx produced via energetic particle precipitation was not significantly elevated. On the other hand, the Arctic polar vortex at stratopause altitudes in Feb 2006 was exceptionally strong, implying greater confinement of air in the polar night. Carbon monoxide data also indicate enhanced confined descent of air from the mesosphere. These results confirm that impacts of EPP on the atmosphere are modulated by meteorological conditions; this has implications for understanding interannual variability and trends in stratospheric NOx and ozone.		1

The instrument is capable to retrieve the vertical distribution of temperature and trace gases, aiming at the study of climate and atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and at applications to data assimilation and weather forecasting. MIPAS operated in its standard observation mode for approximately two years, from July 2002 to March 2004, with scans performed at nominal spectral resolution of 0.025 cm−1 and covering the altitude range from the mesosphere to the upper troposphere with relatively high vertical resolution (about 3 km in the stratosphere). Only reduced spectral resolution measurements have been performed subsequently. MIPAS data were re-processed by ESA using updated versions of the Instrument Processing Facility (IPF v4.61 and v4.62) and provided a complete set of level-2 operational products (geo-located vertical profiles of temperature and volume mixing ratio of H2O, O3, HNO3, CH4, N2O and NO2) with quasi continuous and global coverage in the period of MIPAS full spectral resolution mission. In this paper, we report a detailed description of the validation of MIPAS-ENVISAT operational ozone data, that was based on the comparison between MIPAS v4.61 (and, to a lesser extent, v4.62) O3 VMR profiles and a comprehensive set of correlative data, including observations from ozone sondes, ground-based lidar, FTIR and microwave radiometers, remote-sensing and in situ instruments on-board stratospheric aircraft and balloons, concurrent satellite sensors and ozone fields assimilated by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting. \r\n\r\nA coordinated effort was carried out, using common criteria for the selection of individual validation data sets, and similar methods for the comparisons. This enabled merging the individual results from a variety of independent reference measurements of proven quality (i.e. well characterized error budget) into an overall evaluation of MIPAS O3 data quality, having both statistical strength and the widest spatial and temporal coverage. Collocated measurements from ozone sondes and ground-based lidar and microwave radiometers of the Network for the Detection Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) were selected to carry out comparisons with time series of MIPAS O3 partial columns and to identify groups of stations and time periods with a uniform pattern of ozone differences, that were subsequently used for a vertically resolved statistical analysis. The results of the comparison are classified according to synoptic and regional systems and to altitude intervals, showing a generally good agreement within the comparison error bars in the upper and middle stratosphere. Significant differences emerge in the lower stratosphere and are only partly explained by the larger contributions of horizontal and vertical smoothing differences and of collocation errors to the total uncertainty. Further results obtained from a purely statistical analysis of the same data set from NDACC ground-based lidar stations, as well as from additional ozone soundings at middle latitudes and from NDACC ground-based FTIR measurements, confirm the validity of MIPAS O3 profiles down to the lower stratosphere, with evidence of larger discrepancies at the lowest altitudes. The validation against O3 VMR profiles using collocated observations performed by other satellite sensors (SAGE II, POAM III, ODIN-SMR, ACE-FTS, HALOE, GOME) and ECMWF assimilated ozone fields leads to consistent results, that are to a great extent compatible with those obtained from the comparison with ground-based measurements. Excellent agreement in the full vertical range of the comparison is shown with respect to collocated ozone data from stratospheric aircraft and balloon instruments, that was mostly obtained in very good spatial and temporal coincidence with MIPAS scans. This might suggest that the larger differences observed in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere with respect to collocated ground-based and satellite O3 data are only partly due to a degradation of MIPAS data quality. They should be rather largely ascribed to the natural variability of these altitude regions and to other components of the comparison errors. By combining the results of this large number of validation data sets we derived a general assessment of MIPAS v4.61 and v4.62 ozone data quality. \r\n\r\nA clear indication of the validity of MIPAS O3 vertical profiles is obtained for most of the stratosphere, where the mean relative difference with the individual correlative data sets is always lower than ±10%. Furthermore, these differences always fall within the combined systematic error (from 1 hPa to 50 hPa) and the standard deviation is fully consistent with the random error of the comparison (from 1 hPa to ~30–40 hPa). A degradation in the quality of the agreement is generally observed in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, with biases up to 25% at 100 hPa and standard deviation of the global mean differences up to three times larger than the combined random error in the range 50–100 hPa. The larger differences observed at the bottom end of MIPAS retrieved profiles can be associated, as already noticed, to the effects of stronger atmospheric gradients in the UTLS that are perceived differently by the various measurement techniques. However, further components that may degrade the results of the comparison at lower altitudes can be identified as potentially including cloud contamination, which is likely not to have been fully filtered using the current settings of the MIPAS cloud detection algorithm, and in the linear approximation of the forward model that was used for the a priori estimate of systematic error components. The latter, when affecting systematic contributions with a random variability over the spatial and temporal scales of global averages, might result in an underestimation of the random error of the comparison and add up to other error sources, such as the possible underestimates of the p and T error propagation based on the assumption of a 1 K and 2% uncertainties, respectively, on MIPAS temperature and pressure retrievals. \r\n\r\nAt pressure lower than 1 hPa, only a small fraction of the selected validation data set provides correlative ozone data of adequate quality and it is difficult to derive quantitative conclusions about the performance of MIPAS O3 retrieval for the topmost layers.		1

As such, the inconsistency between observations of its abundance and estimated sources and sinks is an important problem requiring urgent attention (Carpenter et al., 2014) [5]. Satellite remote-sensing has a role to play, particularly limb sounders which can provide vertical profiles into the stratosphere and therefore validate stratospheric loss rates in atmospheric models.\r\n\r\nThis work is in two parts. The first describes new and improved high-resolution infra-red absorption cross sections of carbon tetrachloride/dry synthetic air over the spectral range 700–860 cm−1 for a range of temperatures and pressures (7.5–760 Torr and 208–296 K) appropriate for atmospheric conditions. This new cross-section dataset improves upon the one currently available in the HITRAN and GEISA databases. The second describes a new, preliminary ACE-FTS carbon tetrachloride retrieval that improves upon the v3.0/v3.5 data products, which are biased high by up to ~20–30% relative to ground measurements. Making use of the new spectroscopic data, this retrieval also improves the microwindow selection, contains additional interfering species, and utilises a new instrumental lineshape; it will form the basis for the upcoming v4.0 CCl4 data product.		1

The study compares the data from various limb-viewing instruments with model simulations from the middle stratosphere to the lower mesosphere. Data from three sub-millimetre instruments and two infrared spectrometers are used, namely from the Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR) on board Odin, the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board Aura, the Superconducting Submillimeter-wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) on the International Space Station, the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on board ENVISAT, and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on board SCISAT. Inter-comparison of the measurements from instruments on sun-synchronous satellites (SMR, MLS, MIPAS) and measurements from solar occultation instruments (ACE-FTS) is challenging since the measurements correspond to different solar zenith angles (or local times). However, using a model which covers all solar zenith angles and data from the SMILES instrument which measured at all local times over a period of several months provides the possibility to verify the model and to indirectly compare the diurnally variable species. The satellite data were averaged for latitudes of 20° S to 20° N for the SMILES observation period from November 2009 to April 2010 and were compared at three altitudes: 35, 45 and 55 km. Besides presenting the SMILES data, the study also shows a first comparison of the latest MLS data (version 3.3) of HOCl, ClO, and HO2 with other satellite observations, as well as a first evaluation of HO2 observations made by Odin/SMR. The MISU-1D model has been carefully initialised and run for conditions and locations of the observations. The diurnal cycle features for the species investigated here are generally well reproduced by the model. The satellite observations and the model agree well in terms of absolute mixing ratios. The differences between the day and night values of the model are in good agreement with the observations although the amplitude of the HO2 diurnal variation is 10–20% lower in the model than in the observations. In particular, the data offered the opportunity to study the reaction ClO+HO2 → HOCl+O2 in the lower mesosphere at 55 km. At this altitude the HOCl night-time variation depends only on this reaction. The result of this analysis points towards a value of the rate constant within the range of the JPL 2006 recommendation and the upper uncertainty limit of the JPL 2011 recommendation at 55 km.		1

Using a middle atmosphere GCM we investigate whether solar proton events or subsequent associated aurorae can explain the NOx observations. We find that the solar proton events produce insufficient amounts of NOx, less than 2 ppmv at 90 km. However, it is likely that intense aurorae associated with the Oct.–Nov. 2003 solar storms, and their aftermath, produced thermospheric values of NOx reaching hundreds of ppmv. In addition, from our simulations we infer that NOx rich air must have experienced unusually confined polar night descent in the mesosphere in December and January.		1

Currently, there are four MIPAS ozone data products, including the operational Level-2 ozone product processed at ESA, with the scientific prototype processor being operated at IFAC Florence, and three independent research products developed by the Istituto di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara (ISAC-CNR)/University of Bologna, Oxford University, and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology–Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research/Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (KIT–IMK/IAA). Here we present a dataset of ozone vertical profiles obtained by merging ozone retrievals from four independent Level-2 MIPAS processors. We also discuss the advantages and the shortcomings of this merged product. As the four processors retrieve ozone in different parts of the spectra (microwindows), the source measurements can be considered as nearly independent with respect to measurement noise. Hence, the information content of the merged product is greater and the precision is better than those of any parent (source) dataset.\r\n\r\nThe merging is performed on a profile per profile basis. Parent ozone profiles are weighted based on the corresponding error covariance matrices; the error correlations between different profile levels are taken into account. The intercorrelations between the processors' errors are evaluated statistically and are used in the merging. The height range of the merged product is 20–55 km, and error covariance matrices are provided as diagnostics. Validation of the merged dataset is performed by comparison with ozone profiles from ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder). Even though the merging is not supposed to remove the biases of the parent datasets, around the ozone volume mixing ratio peak the merged product is found to have a smaller (up to 0.1 ppmv) bias with respect to ACE-FTS than any of the parent datasets. The bias with respect to MLS is of the order of 0.15 ppmv at 20–30 km height and up to 0.45 ppmv at larger altitudes. The agreement between the merged data MIPAS dataset with ACE-FTS is better than that with MLS. This is, however, the case for all parent processors as well.		1

ACE was launched into a low Earth circular orbit by NASA on August 12, 2003 and it continues to function nominally. The ACE instruments are a high spectral resolution (0.02 cm−1) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) operating from 2.2 to 13.3 μm (750–4400 cm−1), a spectrophotometer known as Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO) with wavelength coverage of 285–1020 nm and two filtered detector arrays to image the Sun at 0.525 and 1.02 μm. ACE operates in solar occultation mode to provide altitude profiles of temperature, pressure, atmospheric extinction and the volume mixing ratios (VMRs) for several dozen molecules and related isotopologues. This paper presents a mission overview and a summary of selected scientific results.		1

These comparisons aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the typical uncertainties in the observational database which can be considered in subsequent observational and modelling studies. For the amplitudes, a good agreement of their latitude and altitude distribution was found. Quantitatively there were differences in particular at high latitudes, close to the tropopause and in the lower mesosphere. In these regions, the standard deviation over all data sets typically exceeded 0.2 ppmv for the annual variation and 0.1 ppmv for the semi-annual and quasi-biennial variation. For the phase, larger differences between the data sets were found in the lower mesosphere. Generally the smallest phase uncertainties can be observed in regions where the amplitude of the variability is large. The standard deviations of the phases for all data sets were typically smaller than a month for the annual and semi-annual variation and smaller than 5 months for the quasi-biennial variation. The amplitude and phase differences among the data sets are caused by a combination of factors. In general, differences in the temporal variation of systematic errors and in the observational sampling play a dominant role. In addition, differences in the vertical resolution of the data, the considered time periods and influences of clouds, aerosols as well as non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects cause differences between the individual data sets.		1

SSD values were determined from solar occultation measurements based on data obtained from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II, the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE–FTS). The SSD was negative at altitudes of 20–30 km (−0.1 ppmv at 25 km) and positive at 30–50 km (+0.2 ppmv at 40–45 km) for HALOE and ACE–FTS data. SAGE II data also showed a qualitatively similar result, although the SSD in the upper stratosphere was 2 times larger than those derived from the other data sets. On the basis of an analysis of data from the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) and a nudged chemical transport model (the specified dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model: SD–WACCM), we conclude that the SSD can be explained by diurnal variations in the ozone concentration, particularly those caused by vertical transport by the atmospheric tidal winds. All data sets showed significant seasonal variations in the SSD; the SSD in the upper stratosphere is greatest from December through February, while that in the lower stratosphere reaches a maximum twice: during the periods March–April and September–October. Based on an analysis of SD–WACCM results, we found that these seasonal variations follow those associated with the tidal vertical winds.		1

The models included in the comparison are the 3-D chemistry transport model 3dCTM, the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, FinROSE, the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA), the Karlsruhe Simulation Model of the Middle Atmosphere (KASIMA), the modelling tools for SOlar Climate Ozone Links studies (SOCOL and CAO-SOCOL), and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM4). The comparison focuses on the energetic particle precipitation (EPP) indirect effect, that is, the polar winter descent of NOx largely produced by EPP in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A particular emphasis is given to the impact of the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in January 2009 and the subsequent elevated stratopause (ES) event associated with enhanced descent of mesospheric air. The chemistry climate model simulations have been nudged toward reanalysis data in the troposphere and stratosphere while being unconstrained above. An odd nitrogen upper boundary condition obtained from MIPAS observations has further been applied to medium-top models. Most models provide a good representation of the mesospheric tracer descent in general, and the EPP indirect effect in particular, during the unperturbed (pre-SSW) period of the NH winter 2008/2009. The observed NOx descent into the lower mesosphere and stratosphere is generally reproduced within 20 %. Larger discrepancies of a few model simulations could be traced back either to the impact of the models' gravity wave drag scheme on the polar wintertime meridional circulation or to a combination of prescribed NOx mixing ratio at the uppermost model layer and low vertical resolution. In March–April, after the ES event, however, modelled mesospheric and stratospheric NOx distributions deviate significantly from the observations. The too-fast and early downward propagation of the NOx tongue, encountered in most simulations, coincides with a temperature high bias in the lower mesosphere (0.2–0.05 hPa), likely caused by an overestimation of descent velocities. In contrast, upper-mesospheric temperatures (at 0.05–0.001 hPa) are generally underestimated by the high-top models after the onset of the ES event, being indicative for too-slow descent and hence too-low NOx fluxes. As a consequence, the magnitude of the simulated NOx tongue is generally underestimated by these models. Descending NOx amounts simulated with medium-top models are on average closer to the observations but show a large spread of up to several hundred percent. This is primarily attributed to the different vertical model domains in which the NOx upper boundary condition is applied. In general, the intercomparison demonstrates the ability of state-of-the-art atmospheric models to reproduce the EPP indirect effect in dynamically and geomagnetically quiescent NH winter conditions. The encountered differences between observed and simulated NOx, CO, and temperature distributions during the perturbed phase of the 2009 NH winter, however, emphasize the need for model improvements in the dynamical representation of elevated stratopause events in order to allow for a better description of the EPP indirect effect under these particular conditions.		1

The model can be incorporated into radiative transfer codes to allow fast calculation of all relevant emission and absorption features in the solar spectrum in the mid-infrared region from 700 to 5000cm-1. The transmittance is modelled as a function of the diameter of the field-of-view centered on the solar disk: the line broadening due to solar rotation as well as center-to-limb variations in strength and width are taken into account for stronger lines. Applications of the model presented here are in the fields of terrestrial remote sensing in the mid-infrared spectral region when the sun is used as radiation source or scattered solar radiation contributes to the measured signal and in the fields of atmospheric radiative transfer algorithms which compute the propagation of infrared solar radiation in the terrestrial atmosphere.		1

Conventionally, estimates of methane sources are derived by bridging emissions inventories with atmospheric observations employing chemical transport models. The accuracy of this approach requires correctly simulating advection and chemical loss such that modeled methane concentrations scale with surface fluxes. When total column measurements are assimilated into this framework, modeled stratospheric methane introduces additional potential for error. To evaluate the impact of such errors, we compare Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and GEOS-Chem total and tropospheric column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane. We find that the model's stratospheric contribution to the total column is insensitive to perturbations to the seasonality or distribution of tropospheric emissions or loss. In the Northern Hemisphere, we identify disagreement between the measured and modeled stratospheric contribution, which increases as the tropopause altitude decreases, and a temporal phase lag in the model's tropospheric seasonality driven by transport errors. Within the context of GEOS-Chem, we find that the errors in tropospheric advection partially compensate for the stratospheric methane errors, masking inconsistencies between the modeled and measured tropospheric methane. These seasonally varying errors alias into source attributions resulting from model inversions. In particular, we suggest that the tropospheric phase lag error leads to large misdiagnoses of wetland emissions in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.		1

An additional (and separate from the actual) hydrological cycle has been introduced into the chemistry–climate model EMAC, including the water isotopologues HDO and H218O and their physical fractionation processes. Additionally an explicit computation of the contribution of methane oxidation to H2O and HDO has been incorporated. The model expansions allow detailed analyses of water vapour and its isotope ratio with respect to deuterium throughout the stratosphere and in the transition region to the troposphere. In order to assure the correct representation of the water isotopologues in the model's hydrological cycle, the expanded system has been evaluated in several steps. The physical fractionation effects have been evaluated by comparison of the simulated isotopic composition of precipitation with measurements from a ground-based network (GNIP) and with the results from the isotopologue-enabled general circulation model ECHAM5-wiso. The model's representation of the chemical HDO precursor CH3D in the stratosphere has been confirmed by a comparison with chemical transport models (1-D, CHEM2D) and measurements from radiosonde flights. Finally, the simulated stratospheric HDO and the isotopic composition of water vapour have been evaluated, with respect to retrievals from three different satellite instruments (MIPAS, ACE-FTS, SMR). Discrepancies in stratospheric water vapour isotope ratios between two of the three satellite retrievals can now partly be explained.		1

The multi-spectrum approach consists of simultaneously combining, during the retrievals, all spectra recorded consecutively during the same day and with the same resolution. Solar observations analyzed in this study with the SFIT-2 v3.91 fitting algorithm correspond to more than 2900 spectra recorded between January 2000 and December 2007 at high zenith angles, with a Fourier Transform Spectrometer operated at the high-altitude International Scientific Station of the Jungfraujoch (ISSJ, 46.5° N latitude, 8.0° E longitude, 3580 m altitude), Switzerland. The goal of the retrieval strategy described here is to provide information about the vertical distribution of carbonyl fluoride. The microwindows used are located in the ν4 or in the ν4 COF2 infrared (IR) absorption bands. Averaging kernel and eigenvector analysis indicates that our FTIR retrieval is sensitive to COF2 inversion between 17 and 30 km, with the major contribution to the retrieved information always coming from the measurement. Moreover, there was no significant bias between COF2 partial columns, total columns or VMR profiles retrieved from the two bands. For each wavenumber region, a complete error budget including all identified sources has been carefully established. In addition, comparisons of FTIR COF2 17–30 km partial columns with KASIMA and SLIMCAT 3-D CTMs are also presented. If we do not notice any significant bias between FTIR and SLIMCAT time series, KASIMA COF2 17–30 km partial columns are lower of around 25%, probably due to incorrect lower boundary conditions. For each times series, linear trend estimation for the 2000–2007 time period as well as a seasonal variation study are also performed and critically discussed. For FTIR and KASIMA time series, very low COF2 growth rates (0.4±0.2%/year and 0.3±0.2%/year, respectively) have been derived. However, the SLIMCAT data set gives a slight negative trend (−0.5±0.2%/year), probably ascribable to discontinuities in the meteorological data used by this model. We further demonstrate that all time series are able to reproduce the COF2 seasonal cycle, which main seasonal characteristics deduced from each data set agree quite well.		1

Two methods based on changes in the correlations of odd nitrogen (NOy) versus methane and versus an artificial long-lived tracer are employed. The observations show that significant denitrification occurred in the region 15 km–20 km and that it was spatially inhomogeneous within the polar vortex. Before the vortex breakup in mid-March 2005 a maximum denitrification of 8 ± 0.8 ppbv, accounting for a relative reduction of over 50%, was observed at ∼450 K (∼17 km) using both methods. When averaged over the polar vortex for the first half of March, the denitrification at this level was about 4.4 ppbv and 5.0 ppbv from the artificial tracer method and the correlation method, respectively.		1

Near-global space-borne measurements of seasonally resolved upper tropospheric profiles of methanol (CH3OH) by the ACE Fourier transform spectrometer provide a unique opportunity to evaluate our understanding of this important oxygenated organic species. ACE-FTS observations from March 2004 to August 2005 period are presented. These observations reveal the pervasive imprint of surface sources on upper tropospheric methanol: mixing ratios observed in the mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere reflect the seasonal cycle of the biogenic emissions whereas the methanol cycle observed in the southern tropics is highly influenced by biomass burning emissions. The comparison with distributions simulated by the state-of-the-art global chemistry transport model, LMDz-INCA, suggests that: (i) the background methanol (high southern latitudes) is correctly represented by the model considering the measurement uncertainties; (ii) the current emissions from the continental biosphere are underestimated during spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere leading to an underestimation of modelled upper tropospheric methanol; (iii) the seasonal variation of upper tropospheric methanol is shifted to the fall in the model suggesting either an insufficient destruction of CH3OH (due to too weak chemistry and/or deposition) in fall and winter months or an unfaithful representation of transport; (iv) the impact of tropical biomass burning emissions on upper tropospheric methanol is rather well reproduced by the model. This study illustrates the potential of these first global profile observations of oxygenated compounds in the upper troposphere to improve our understanding of their global distribution, fate and budget.		1

From this, we find an increase of atmospheric methane total columns of 0.31 ± 0.03 % year−1 (2σ level of uncertainty) for the 2005–2014 period. Comparisons with in situ methane measurements at both local and global scales show good agreement. We used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model tagged simulation, which accounts for the contribution of each emission source and one sink in the total methane, simulated over 2005–2012. After regridding according to NDACC vertical layering using a conservative regridding scheme and smoothing by convolving with respective FTIR seasonal averaging kernels, the GEOS-Chem simulation shows an increase of atmospheric methane total columns of 0.35 ± 0.03 % year−1 between 2005 and 2012, which is in agreement with NDACC measurements over the same time period (0.30 ± 0.04 % year−1, averaged over 10 stations). Analysis of the GEOS-Chem-tagged simulation allows us to quantify the contribution of each tracer to the global methane change since 2005. We find that natural sources such as wetlands and biomass burning contribute to the interannual variability of methane. However, anthropogenic emissions, such as coal mining, and gas and oil transport and exploration, which are mainly emitted in the Northern Hemisphere and act as secondary contributors to the global budget of methane, have played a major role in the increase of atmospheric methane observed since 2005. Based on the GEOS-Chem-tagged simulation, we discuss possible cause(s) for the increase of methane since 2005, which is still unexplained.		1

The average maximum ozone loss was about 2.1 ppmv at 475 K–500 K (∼18 km–20 km). Over 60% of the ozone between 425 K–475 K (∼16 km–18 km) was destroyed. The average total column ozone loss was 119 DU, ∼20–30 DU larger than the largest previously observed Arctic ozone loss in the winter 1999/2000.		1

Model fields are sampled using real sampling patterns from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), the HALogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). The MLS sampling acts as a proxy for a dense uniform sampling pattern typical of limb emission sounders, while HALOE and ACE-FTS represent coarse nonuniform sampling patterns characteristic of solar occultation instruments. First, this study revisits the impact of sampling patterns in terms of the sampling bias, as previous studies have done. Then, it quantifies the impact of different sampling patterns on the estimation of trends and their associated detectability. In general, we find that coarse nonuniform sampling patterns may introduce non-negligible errors in the inferred magnitude of temperature and trace gas trends and necessitate considerably longer records for their definitive detection. Lastly, we explore the impact of these sampling patterns on tropical vertical velocities derived from stratospheric water vapor measurements. We find that coarse nonuniform sampling may lead to a biased depiction of the tropical vertical velocities and, hence, to a biased estimation of the impact of the mechanisms that modulate these velocities. These case studies suggest that dense uniform sampling such as that available from limb emission sounders provides much greater fidelity in detecting signals of stratospheric change (for example, fingerprints of greenhouse gas warming and stratospheric ozone recovery) than coarse nonuniform sampling such as that of solar occultation instruments.		1

Chemistry-transport models (CTMs) therefore need to simulate the tropospheric and stratospheric fractional columns of XCH4 accurately for estimating surface emissions from XCH4. Simulations from three CTMs are tested against XCH4 observations from the Total Carbon Column Network (TCCON). We analyze how the model–TCCON agreement in XCH4 depends on the model representation of stratospheric CH4 distributions. Model equivalents of TCCON XCH4 are computed with stratospheric CH4 fields from both the model simulations and from satellite-based CH4 distributions from MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) and MIPAS CH4 fields adjusted to ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer) observations. Using MIPAS-based stratospheric CH4 fields in place of model simulations improves the model–TCCON XCH4 agreement for all models. For the Atmospheric Chemistry Transport Model (ACTM) the average XCH4 bias is significantly reduced from 38.1 to 13.7 ppb, whereas small improvements are found for the models TM5 (Transport Model, version 5; from 8.7 to 4.3 ppb) and LMDz (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique model with zooming capability; from 6.8 to 4.3 ppb). Replacing model simulations with MIPAS stratospheric CH4 fields adjusted to ACE-FTS reduces the average XCH4 bias for ACTM (3.3 ppb), but increases the average XCH4 bias for TM5 (10.8 ppb) and LMDz (20.0 ppb). These findings imply that model errors in simulating stratospheric CH4 contribute to model biases. Current satellite instruments cannot definitively measure stratospheric CH4 to sufficient accuracy to eliminate these biases. Applying transport diagnostics to the models indicates that model-to-model differences in the simulation of stratospheric transport, notably the age of stratospheric air, can largely explain the inter-model spread in stratospheric CH4 and, hence, its contribution to XCH4. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to analyze how individual model components (e.g., physical parameterization, meteorological data sets, model horizontal/vertical resolution) impact the simulation of stratospheric CH4 and XCH4.		1

Their buildup resulted from the intensive use of man-made halogenated source gases, in particular CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl2F2), during the second half of the 20th century. It is important to continue monitoring the evolution of these source gases and reservoirs, in support of the Montreal Protocol and also indirectly of the Kyoto Protocol. The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) is a space-based instrument that has been performing regular solar occultation measurements of over 30 atmospheric gases since early 2004. In this validation paper, the HCl, HF, CFC-11 and CFC-12 version 2.2 profile data products retrieved from ACE-FTS measurements are evaluated. Volume mixing ratio profiles have been compared to observations made from space by MLS and HALOE, and from stratospheric balloons by SPIRALE, FIRS-2 and Mark-IV. Partial columns derived from the ACE-FTS data were also compared to column measurements from ground-based Fourier transform instruments operated at 12 sites. ACE-FTS data recorded from March 2004 to August 2007 have been used for the comparisons. These data are representative of a variety of atmospheric and chemical situations, with sounded air masses extending from the winter vortex to summer sub-tropical conditions. Typically, the ACE-FTS products are available in the 10–50 km altitude range for HCl and HF, and in the 7–20 and 7–25 km ranges for CFC-11 and -12, respectively. For both reservoirs, comparison results indicate an agreement generally better than 5–10% above 20 km altitude, when accounting for the known offset affecting HALOE measurements of HCl and HF. Larger positive differences are however found for comparisons with single profiles from FIRS-2 and SPIRALE. For CFCs, the few coincident measurements available suggest that the differences probably remain within ±20%.		1

We show that the fluctuations of lower stratospheric water vapor in the subseasonal and multiyear time windows are generated by different physical mechanisms. In the subseasonal time window, the spatial pattern of the coherence between 100 hPa temperature and water vapor, and the time lag, show that the variability in lower stratospheric water vapor is dominated by fluctuations in upwelling forced by the dissipation of tropical Rossby waves. In the multiyear time window, the variability of lower stratospheric water vapor is more strongly coherent with temperature fluctuations on the 100 hPa surface in regions where the annual mean temperature is colder than 194 K. In addition, the 68 hPa water vapor anomalies lag the 100 hPa temperature anomalies by roughly 140 days. In this time window, the variability of lower stratospheric water vapor is therefore dominated by changes in the temperature dependent dehydration efficiency which modulate the water vapor stratospheric entry mixing ratio. On subseasonal timescales, the spatial pattern of the coherence between 100 hPa temperature and 68 hPa CO anomalies is very similar to the pattern of coherence between 100 hPa temperature and the Real-time Multivariate MJO series 1 (RMM1) index of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). The MJO therefore has a strong influence on the subseasonal variability of CO in the lower stratosphere. The subseasonal 68 hPa CO and H2O anomalies lag the 100 hPa temperature anomalies by 3.16 and 2.51 days, respectively. The similarity between the two time lags suggests that the subseasonal CO anomalies can also be attributed to changes in upwelling. The multiyear variability in lower stratospheric N2O appears to be dominated by the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO).		1

Over the past quarter century this subject has evolved from a basic recognition of the Brewer-Dobson circulation to a detailed appreciation of many key features of transport such as the stratospheric surf zone, mixing barriers, and the dynamics of filamentation. Whilst the elegant theoretical framework for middle atmosphere transport that emerged roughly twenty years ago never fu1filled its promise, usefu1 phenomenological models have been developed together with innovative diagnostic methods. These advances were made possible by the advent of plentiful satellite and aircraft observations of long-lived chemical species together with developments in data assimilation and numerical modeling, and have been driven in large measure by the problem of stratospheric ozone depletion. This review is primarily focused on the stratosphere, where both the interest and the knowledge are the greatest, but a few remarks are also made on the mesosphere.		1

"Global" results are presented for MLS measurements of atmospheric temperature, ozone, water vapor, hydrogen chloride, nitrous oxide, nitric acid, and carbon monoxide, with a focus on the January-March 2005 time period. These global comparisons are made using long-standing global satellites and meteorological datasets, as well as some measurements from more recently launched satellites. Comparisons of MLS data with measurements from the Ft. Sumner, NM, September 2004 balloon flights are also presented. Overall, good agreement is obtained, often within 5% to 10%, but we point out certain issues to resolve and some larger systematic differences; some artifacts in the first publicly released MLS (version 1.5) dataset are noted. We comment briefly on future plans for validation and software improvements.		1

The derivation method is based on empirical relationships between these species established using observations from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment---Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on the SCISAT I satellite. The observed correlation between CH4 and N2O from ACE-FTS is used to derive CH4 from MLS measurements of N2O in the lower stratosphere, extending from a pressure of 100 hPa to a range of 30--10 hPa, depending on atmospheric conditions. In the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, between 30--10 hPa and 0.1 hPa, correlations between CH4 and H2O are used to derive CH4 from MLS measurements of H2O. Coincident MLS measurements of CO are utilized to separate two distinct air mass regimes in the CH4 - H2O relationship. This new methane data set covers all seasons and latitudes observed by MLS over the course of the Aura mission from 2004 to 2014. Examples are shown demonstrating the consistency of MLS derived CH4 with other trace gas measurements.		1

All coincidences took place between January 31 and August 5, 2004, with the majority in the Northern Hemisphere. ACE-OSIRIS statistical comparisons were performed in the altitude range of 16–32 km where OSIRIS ozone data are in a good agreement, 5–7%, with another satellite and ground-based instruments. At altitudes 3–5 km above and below the ozone peak, ACE-FTS and OSIRIS profiles agree to within ∼4–7%, while in the vicinity of the peak the ACE-FTS profiles are systematically lower than OSIRIS profiles by about 10%. This result is consistent for all latitudes between 30°S and 82°N.		1

The stratospheric nitric acid (HNO3) from September 2002 to March 2004 was retrieved from the MIPAS observations using the science-oriented data processor developed at the Institut für Meteorologie und Klimaforschung (IMK), which is complemented by the component of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) treatment from the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA). The IMK-IAA research product, different from the ESA operational product, is validated in this paper by comparison with a number of reference data sets. Individual HNO3 profiles of the IMK-IAA MIPAS show good agreement with those of the balloon-borne version of MIPAS (MIPAS-B) and the infrared spectrometer MkIV, with small differences of less than 0.5 ppbv throughout the entire altitude range up to about 38 km, and below 0.2 ppbv above 30 km. However, the degree of consistency is largely affected by their temporal and spatial coincidence, and differences of 1 to 2 ppbv may be observed between 22 and 26 km at high latitudes near the vortex boundary, due to large horizontal inhomogeneity of HNO3. Statistical comparisons of MIPAS IMK-IAA HNO3 VMRs with respect to those of satellite measurements of Odin/SMR, ILAS-II, ACE-FTS, as well as the MIPAS ESA product show good consistency. The mean differences are generally ±0.5 ppbv and standard deviations of the differences are of 0.5 to 1.5 ppbv. The maximum differences are 2.0 ppbv around 20 to 25 km. This gives confidence in the general reliability of MIPAS HNO3 VMR data and the other three satellite data sets.		1

However, to date the complexity of the ion chemistry below the mesopause (i.e., in the D region ionosphere) has restricted global models to simplified EEP/IC parameterizations which are unable to reproduce some important effects, e.g., the increase of mesospheric nitric acid (HNO3). Here we use WACCM-D, a variant of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model which includes a selected set of D region ion chemistry designed to produce the observed effects of EPP/IC. We evaluate the performance of EPP/IC modeling by comparing WACCM-D results for the January 2005 solar proton event (SPE) to those from the standard WACCM and Aura/Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and SCISAT/Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) observations. The results indicate that WACCM-D improves the modeling of HNO3, HCl, ClO, OH, and NOx during the SPE. Northern Hemispheric HNO3 from WACCM-D shows an increase by 2 orders of magnitude at 40–70 km compared to WACCM, reaching 2.6 ppbv, in agreement with the observations. For HCl and ClO, the improvement is most pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere at 40–50 km where WACCM-D predicts a decrease of HCl and increase of ClO by 1.6% and 10%, respectively, similar to MLS data. Compared to WACCM, WACCM-D produces 25–50% less OH and 30–130% more NOx at 70–85 km which leads to better agreement with the observations. Although not addressed here, longer-term NOx impact of ion chemistry could be important for polar stratospheric ozone and middle atmospheric dynamics.		1

More than 200 lines of the ν3 fundamental band of OCS have been systematically evaluated and we selected 4 microwindows on the basis of objective criteria minimizing the effect of interferences, mainly by solar features, carbon dioxide and water vapor absorption lines, while maximizing the information content. Implementation of this new retrieval strategy provided an extended time series of the OCS abundance spanning the 1995–2015 time period, for the study of the long-term trend and seasonal variation of OCS in the free troposphere and stratosphere.\r\n\r\nThree distinct periods characterize the evolution of the tropospheric partial columns: a first decreasing period (1995–2002), an intermediate increasing period (2002–2008), and the more recent period (2008–2015) which shows no significant trend. Our FTIR tropospheric and stratospheric time series are compared with new in situ gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) measurements performed by Empa (Laboratory for Air Pollution/Environmental Technology) at the Jungfraujoch since 2008, and with space-borne solar occultation observations by the ACE-FTS instrument on-board the SCISAT satellite, respectively, and they show good agreement. The OCS signal recorded above Jungfraujoch appears to be closely related to anthropogenic sulfur emissions.		1

Because of the central role of water vapour (WV) and ozone (O3) in climate change, it is important to understand how accurately and consistently these species are represented in existing global reanalyses. In this paper, we present the results of WV and O3 intercomparisons that have been performed as part of the SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate) Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP). The comparisons cover a range of timescales and evaluate both inter-reanalysis and observation-reanalysis differences. We also provide a systematic documentation of the treatment of WV and O3 in current reanalyses to aid future research and guide the interpretation of differences amongst reanalysis fields.\r\n\r\nThe assimilation of total column ozone (TCO) observations in newer reanalyses results in realistic representations of TCO in reanalyses except when data coverage is lacking, such as during polar night. The vertical distribution of ozone is also relatively well represented in the stratosphere in reanalyses, particularly given the relatively weak constraints on ozone vertical structure provided by most assimilated observations and the simplistic representations of ozone photochemical processes in most of the reanalysis forecast models. However, significant biases in the vertical distribution of ozone are found in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in all reanalyses.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to O3, reanalysis estimates of stratospheric WV are not directly constrained by assimilated data. Observations of atmospheric humidity are typically used only in the troposphere, below a specified vertical level at or near the tropopause. The fidelity of reanalysis stratospheric WV products is therefore mainly dependent on the reanalyses' representation of the physical drivers that influence stratospheric WV, such as temperatures in the tropical tropopause layer, methane oxidation, and the stratospheric overturning circulation. The lack of assimilated observations and known deficiencies in the representation of stratospheric transport in reanalyses result in much poorer agreement amongst observational and reanalysis estimates of stratospheric WV. Hence, stratospheric WV products from the current generation of reanalyses should generally not be used in scientific studies.		11

The distributions of reactive trace gases involved in the photochemistry of CO, including OH, CH4, O(1D), Cl, as well as temperatures for calculating reaction rates, are either directly observed or constrained from observations. We map the CO net production and loss as a function of pressure (10–0.02 hPa, about 30–75 km altitude), latitude (approximately ±70°), and season. The results indicate that photochemical loss dominates over production for nearly all conditions considered here. A minimum photochemical loss lifetime of about 10 days occurs near the 2 hPa pressure level, and it follows the region of maximum sunlight exposure. At high latitudes during winter, the CO lifetime is generally longer than 30 days. Time scales become much shorter in spring, however, when CO lifetimes can be 15–20 days poleward of 60° latitude in the upper stratosphere. On the basis of these results, CO is a suitable tracer during autumn to spring above the 0.1 hPa pressure level but not in the upper stratosphere near 1 hPa.		1

Solar-viewing grating spectrometer measurements recorded in April 1951 at the Jungfraujoch station (46.5°N latitude, 8.0°E longitude, 3.58 km altitude) show evidence for absorption by lines of the strong ν3 band of OCS at 2062 cm−1. The observation predates the earliest previously reported OCS atmosphere remote-sensing measurement by two decades. More recent infrared ground-based measurements of OCS have been obtained primarily with high-resolution solar-viewing Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs). Long-term trends derived from this record span more than two decades and show OCS columns that have remained constant or have decreased slightly with time since the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, though retrievals assuming different versions of public spectroscopic databases have been impacted by OCS ν3 band line intensity differences of ∼10%. The lower stratospheric OCS trend has been inferred assuming spectroscopic parameters from the high-resolution transmission (HITRAN) 2004 database. Volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles measured near 30°N latitude with high-resolution solar-viewing FTSs operating in the solar occultation mode over a 22 years time span were combined. Atmospheric Trace MOlecucle Spectroscopy (ATMOS) version 3 FTS measurements in 1985 and 1994 were used with Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) measurements during 2004–2007. Trends were calculated by referencing the measured OCS VMRs to those of the long-lived constituent N2O to account for variations in the dynamic history of the sampled airmasses. Means and 1-sigma standard deviations of VMRs (in ppbv, or 10−9 per unit air volume) averaged over 30–100 hPa from measurements at 25–35°N latitude are 0.334±0.089 ppbv from 1985 (ATMOS Spacelab 3 measurements), 0.297±0.094 ppbv from 1994 ATLAS 3 measurements, 0.326±0.074 ppbv from ACE 2004 measurements, 0.305±0.096 ppbv from ACE 2005 measurements, 0.328±0.074 from ACE 2006 measurements, and 0.305±0.090 ppbv from ACE measurements through August 2007. Assuming these parameters, we conclude that there has been no statistically significant trend in lower stratospheric OCS over the measurement time span. We discuss past measurement sets, quantify the impact of changes in infrared spectroscopic parameters on atmospheric retrievals and trend measurements, and discuss OCS spectroscopic uncertainties of the current ν3 band parameters in public atmospheric databases.		1

We combine volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles for NO, NO2, HNO3, N2O5, ClONO2, and HNO4 to determine a zonally averaged NOy climatology on monthly and 3 month combined means (December–February, March–May, June–August, and September–November) at 5° latitude spacing and on 33 pressure surfaces. Peak NOy VMR concentrations (15–20 ppbv) are situated at about 3 hPa (∼40 km) in the tropics, while they are typically lower at about 10 hPa (∼30 km) in the midlatitudes. Mean NOy VMRs are similar in both the northern and southern polar regions, with the exception of large enhancements periodically observed in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. These are primarily due to enhancements of NO due to energetic particle precipitation and downward transport. Other features in the NOy budget are related to descent in the polar vortex, heterogeneous chemistry, and denitrification processes. Comparison of the ACE-FTS NOy budget is made to both the Odin and ATMOS NOy data sets, showing in both cases a good level of agreement, such that relative differences are typically better than 20%. The NOy climatological products are available through the ACE website and are a supplement to the paper.		1

The Brewer-Dobson circulation is not well constrained by observations and further investigation is required to resolve uncertainties related to the mechanisms driving the circulation. This study has assessed the specified dynamics mode of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM30) by comparing to the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) profile measurements of CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), and N2O. In the CMAM30 specified dynamics simulation, the meteorological fields are nudged using the ERA-Interim Reanalysis and a specified tracer was used for each species, with hemispherically-defined surface measurements used as the boundary condition. A comprehensive sampling technique along the line-of-sight of the ACE-FTS measurements has been employed to allow for direct comparisons between the simulated and measured tracer concentrations. The model consistently overpredicts tracer concentrations in the lower stratosphere, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring seasons. The three mixing barriers investigated, including the polar vortex, the extratropical tropopause, and the tropical pipe, show that there are significant inconsistencies between the measurements and the simulations. In particular, the CMAM30 simulation exhibits too little isentropic mixing in the June-July-August season.		11

The role of tropospheric-sourced sulfur dioxide (SO2) in maintaining background SAs has been debated for decades without in situ measurements of SO2 at the tropical tropopause to inform this issue. Here we clarify the role of SO2 in maintaining SAs by using new in situ SO2 measurements to evaluate climate models and satellite retrievals. We then use the observed tropical tropopause SO2 mixing ratios to estimate the global flux of SO2 across the tropical tropopause. These analyses show that the tropopause background SO2 is about 5 times smaller than reported by the average satellite observations that have been used recently to test atmospheric models. This shifts the view of SO2 as a dominant source of SAs to a near-negligible one, possibly revealing a significant gap in the SA budget.		1

Using observations from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) we present calculations of the stratospheric lifetimes of CFC-12, CCl4, CH4, CH3Cl and N2O. The lifetimes were calculated using the slope of the tracer–tracer correlation of these species with CFC-11 at the tropopause. The correlation slopes were corrected for the changing atmospheric concentrations of each species based on age of air and CFC-11 measurements from samples taken aboard the Geophysica aircraft – along with the effective linear trend of the volume mixing ratio (VMR) from tropical ground based AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) sites. Stratospheric lifetimes were calculated using a CFC-11 lifetime of 45 yr. These calculations produced values of 113 + (−) 26 (18) yr (CFC-12), 35 + (−) 11 (7) yr (CCl4), 69 + (−) 65 (23) yr (CH3Cl), 123 + (−) 53 (28) yr (N2O) and 195 + (−) 75 (42) yr (CH4). The errors on these values are the weighted 1σ non-systematic errors. Systematic errors were estimated by recalculating lifetimes using VMRs which had been modified to reflect differences between ACE-FTS retrieved VMRs and those from other instruments. The results of these calculations, including systematic errors, were as follows: 113 + (−) 32 (20) for CFC-12, 123 + (−) 83 (35) for N2O, 195 + (−) 139 (57) for CH4, 35 + (−) 14 (8) for CCl4 and 69 + (−) 2119 (34) yr for CH3Cl. For CH3Cl & CH4 this represents the first calculation of the stratospheric lifetime using data from a space based instrument.		1

We have used MIPAS data to study the latitudinal variations of phosgene (COCl2 or carbonyl chloride) and, for the first time, its seasonal variation in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere region (UTLS). Retrievals of phosgene were made using the 830–860 cm−1 region, corresponding to the ν5 bands of COCl2. Unfortunately, in that region, the ν4 band of CFC-11, which is much stronger than COCl2 ν5, hides the phosgene emission. In order to evaluate seasonality and latitudinal distribution of phosgene we have analysed all the measurements made by MIPAS on days 18 and 20 of each month of 2008 with the optimized retrieval model (ORM) recently upgraded with the multi-target retrieval technique and with the optimal estimation functionality to apply external constraints to the state vector. Average seasonal profiles of phosgene show an evident latitudinal variability with the largest values observed in the tropical regions (maximum  ≈  35 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) at about 300 hPa). In the midlatitude and polar regions, the volume mixing ratio (VMR) values do not exceed 30 pptv and the vertical distributions are less peaked. Our analysis highlights that COCl2 seasonal variability is fairly low, apart from the polar regions.		1

The vertical resolution is 4–5 km in the height region 6–15 km and 15 at 40 km altitude. The total estimated error amounts to 40–50 pptv between 10 and 20 km and to 120 pptv at 40 km altitude. MIPAS OCS data show no systematic bias with respect to balloon observations, with deviations mostly below ±50 pptv. However, they are systematically higher than the OCS volume mixing ratios of the ACE-FTS instrument on SCISAT, with maximum deviations of up to 100 pptv in the altitude region 13–16 km. The data set of MIPAS OCS exhibits only moderate interannual variations and low interhemispheric differences. Average concentrations at 10 km altitude range from 480 pptv at high latitudes to 500–510 pptv in the tropics and at northern mid-latitudes. Seasonal variations at 10 km altitude amount to up to 35 pptv in the Northern and up to 15 pptv in the Southern Hemisphere. Northern hemispheric OCS abundances at 10 km altitude peak in June in the tropics and around October at high latitudes, while the respective southern hemispheric maxima were observed in July and in November. Global OCS distributions at 250 hPa (∼ 10–11 km) show enhanced values at low latitudes, peaking during boreal summer above the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean, which indicates oceanic release. Further, a region of depleted OCS amounts extending from Brazil to central and southern Africa was detected at this altitude, which is most pronounced in austral summer. This depletion is related to seasonally varying vegetative uptake by the tropical forests. Typical signatures of biomass burning like the southern hemispheric biomass burning plume are not visible in MIPAS data, indicating that this process is only a minor source of upper tropospheric OCS. At the 150 hPa level (∼ 13–14 km) enhanced amounts of OCS were also observed inside the Asian monsoon anticyclone, but this enhancement is not especially outstanding compared to other low latitude regions at the same altitude. At the 80 hPa level (∼ 17–18 km), equatorward transport of mid-latitude air masses containing lower OCS amounts around the summertime anticyclones was observed. A significant trend could not be detected in upper tropospheric MIPAS OCS amounts, which points to globally balanced sources and sinks. Simulations with the ECHAM-MESSy model reproduce the observed latitudinal cross sections fairly well.		1

Strong	2016	3	Atmospheric Measurement Techniques		Copernicus Publications		9	3	1063-1082		pressure, temperature, ACE-FTS, COSMIC	http://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/9/1063/2016/		publications/pdfs/amt-9-1063-2016.pdf			10.5194/amt-9-1063-2016	f	Motivated by the initial selection of a high-resolution solar occultation Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) to fly to Mars on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, we have been developing algorithms for retrieving volume mixing ratio vertical profiles of trace gases, the primary component of which is a new algorithm and software for retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and pressure from the spectra. In contrast to Earth-observing instruments, which can rely on accurate meteorological models, a priori information, and spacecraft position, Mars retrievals require a method with minimal reliance on such data. The temperature and pressure retrieval algorithms developed for this work were evaluated using Earth-observing spectra from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) FTS, a solar occultation instrument in orbit since 2003, and the basis for the instrument selected for a Mars mission. ACE-FTS makes multiple measurements during an occultation, separated in altitude by 1.5–5 km, and we analyse 10 CO2 vibration–rotation bands at each altitude, each with a different usable altitude range. We describe the algorithms and present results of their application and their comparison to the ACE-FTS data products. The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) provides vertical profiles of temperature up to 40 km with high vertical resolution. Using six satellites and GPS radio occultation, COSMIC's data product has excellent temporal and spatial coverage, allowing us to find coincident measurements with ACE with very tight criteria: less than 1.5 h and 150 km. We present an intercomparison of temperature profiles retrieved from ACE-FTS using our algorithm, that of the ACE Science Team (v3.5), and from COSMIC. When our retrievals are compared to ACE-FTS v3.5, we find mean differences between −5 and +2 K and that our retrieved profiles have no seasonal or zonal biases but do have a warm bias in the stratosphere and a cold bias in the mesosphere. When compared to COSMIC, we do not observe a warm/cool bias and mean differences are between −4 and +1 K. COSMIC comparisons are restricted to below 40 km, where our retrievals have the best agreement with ACE-FTS v3.5. When comparing ACE-FTS v3.5 to COSMIC we observe a cold bias in COSMIC of 0.5 K, and mean differences are between −0.9 and +0.6 K.		1

The product version 4.61/4.62 for the observation period between July 2002 and March 2004 is validated by comparisons with a number of independent observations from ground-based stations, aircraft/balloon campaigns, and satellites. Individual HNO3 profiles of the ESA MIPAS level-2 product show good agreement with those of MIPAS-B and MIPAS-STR (the balloon and aircraft version of MIPAS, respectively), and the balloon-borne infrared spectrometers MkIV and SPIRALE, mostly matching the reference data within the combined instrument error bars. In most cases differences between the correlative measurement pairs are less than 1 ppbv (5–10%) throughout the entire altitude range up to about 38 km (~6 hPa), and below 0.5 ppbv (15–20% or more) above 30 km (~17 hPa). However, differences up to 4 ppbv compared to MkIV have been found at high latitudes in December 2002 in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds. The degree of consistency is further largely affected by the temporal and spatial coincidence, and differences of 2 ppbv may be observed between 22 and 26 km (~50 and 30 hPa) at high latitudes near the vortex boundary, due to large horizontal inhomogeneity of HNO3. Similar features are also observed in the mean differences of the MIPAS ESA HNO3 VMRs with respect to the ground-based FTIR measurements at five stations, aircraft-based SAFIRE-A and ASUR, and the balloon campaign IBEX. The mean relative differences between the MIPAS and FTIR HNO3 partial columns are within ±2%, comparable to the MIPAS systematic error of ~2%. For the vertical profiles, the biases between the MIPAS and FTIR data are generally below 10% in the altitudes of 10 to 30 km. The MIPAS and SAFIRE HNO3 data generally match within their total error bars for the mid and high latitude flights, despite the larger atmospheric inhomogeneities that characterize the measurement scenario at higher latitudes. The MIPAS and ASUR comparison reveals generally good agreements better than 10–13% at 20–34 km. The MIPAS and IBEX measurements agree reasonably well (mean relative differences within ±15%) between 17 and 32 km. Statistical comparisons of the MIPAS profiles correlated with those of Odin/SMR, ILAS-II, and ACE-FTS generally show good consistency. The mean differences averaged over individual latitude bands or all bands are within the combined instrument errors, and generally within 1, 0.5, and 0.3 ppbv between 10 and 40 km (~260 and 4.5 hPa) for Odin/SMR, ILAS-II, and ACE-FTS, respectively. The standard deviations of the differences are between 1 to 2 ppbv. The standard deviations for the satellite comparisons and for almost all other comparisons are generally larger than the estimated measurement uncertainty. This is associated with the temporal and spatial coincidence error and the horizontal smoothing error which are not taken into account in our error budget. Both errors become large when the spatial variability of the target molecule is high.		1

However, the accuracy of the retrieval is currently limited by the uncertainties on the spectroscopic parameters of CFC-113. This paper reports on the geometrical structure, harmonic frequencies and intensities in the mid-infrared region of the two conformers of CFC-113 and the evaluation of whether theoretical calculations reproduce measurements. The calculations are performed using density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level. The molecular geometry parameters, the enthalpy difference and the potential barrier between conformers are calculated. The harmonic frequency of the normal modes of vibration are presented and accurately compared to experimental data. Overtones and combination bands are assigned in the 1200–2500 cm−1 region.		1

This winter is among the coldest on record with large observed ozone losses. It is also different from previously analyzed winters, as ozone mixing ratios within the polar vortex were not homogeneously distributed. The reason for the untypical ozone distribution is a second transport barrier that existed at the time of vortex formation. The simulations agree well with ozone measurements by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). The simulated vortex average column ozone loss between 380 and 550 K potential temperature (±1σ) was 69 ± 21 Dobson Units on 23 March. The simulated ozone loss is in approximate agreement with some published estimates, but is significantly lower than others. A possible reason for this difference is the inhomogeneous ozone distribution within the vortex which makes it more complicated to estimate of ozone loss.		1

It was launched into low Earth circular orbit (altitude 650 km, inclination 74°) on 12 Aug. 2003. The primary ACE instrument is a high spectral resolution (0.02 cm−1) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) operating from 2.2 to 13.3 μm (750–4400 cm−1). The satellite also features a dual spectrophotometer known as MAESTRO with wavelength coverage of 285–1030 nm and spectral resolution of 1–2 nm. A pair of filtered CMOS detector arrays records images of the Sun at 0.525 and 1.02 μm. Working primarily in solar occultation, the satellite provides altitude profile information (typically 10–100 km) for temperature, pressure, and the volume mixing ratios for several dozen molecules of atmospheric interest, as well as atmospheric extinction profiles over the latitudes 85°N to 85°S. This paper presents a mission overview and some of the first scientific results.		1

These measurements were made at Eureka, Nunavut during polar springtime 2004. Six ground-based instruments were operated during the intensive phase of the campaign and ozonesondes and radiosondes were flown. During this time, ACE-FTS and ACE-MAESTRO were performing solar-occultation measurements over the Canadian Arctic. We report the first comparisons between campaign measurements and those from ACE, focusing on O3, NO2 and temperature. Initial mean O3 profiles from ACE-FTS and ACE-MAESTRO agree to within 20% between 10 and 30 km, and the NO2 profiles agree to within 40% between 17 and 40 km, which is within the standard deviations. The ACE-FTS temperature profiles agree to better than 2.5 K with the radiosonde temperatures from 10 to 32 km and with the lidar temperatures from 17 to 45 km.		1

Least square fitting to the spectrum by a synthetic spectrum results in a DCl mixing ratio of 17.8 ± 6.8 ppb. Comparing to the HCl abundance of 400 ± 30 ppb (Krasnopolsky [2010a] Icarus, 208, 314–322), the DCl/HCl ratio is equal to 280 ± 110 times the terrestrial D/H = 1.56 × 10−4. This ratio is similar to that of HDO/H2O = 240 ± 25 times the terrestrial HDO/H2O from the VEX/SOIR occultations at 70–110 km. Photochemistry in the Venus mesosphere converts H from HCl to that in H2O with a rate of 1.9 × 109 cm−2 s−1 (Krasnopolsky [2012] Icarus, 218, 230–246). The conversion involves photolysis of HCl; therefore, the photochemistry tends to enrich D/H in HCl and deplete in H2O. Formation of the sulfuric acid clouds may affect HDO/H2O as well. The enriched HCl moves down by mixing to the lower atmosphere where thermodynamic equilibriums for H2 and HCl near the surface correspond to D/H = 0.71 and 0.74 times that in H2O, respectively. Time to establish these equilibriums is estimated at ∼3 years and comparable to the mixing time in the lower atmosphere. Therefore, the enriched HCl from the mesosphere gives D back to H2O near the surface. Comparison of chemical and mixing times favors a constant HDO/H2O up to ∼100 km and DCl/HCl equal to D/H in H2O times 0.74.\r\nAmmonia is an abundant form of nitrogen in the reducing environments. Thermodynamic equilibriums with N2 and NO near the surface of Venus give its mixing ratio of 10−14 and 6 × 10−7, respectively. A spectrum of Venus near the NH3 line at 4481.11 cm−1 was observed at NASA IRTF and resulted in a two-sigma upper limit of 6 ppb for NH3 above the Venus clouds. This is an improvement of the previous upper limit by a factor of 5. If ammonia exists at the ppb level or less in the lower atmosphere, it quickly dissociates in the mesosphere and weakly affects its photochemistry.		1

The optical spectrograph and infra-red imager system (OSIRIS) instrument on the Odin satellite observes scattered solar radiation at the terrestrial limb from the upper troposphere, the stratosphere, and the mesosphere. The wavelength range, 275 nm to 810 nm includes the OH A2Σ+–X2Π 0–0 band at 308 nm, which is seen in solar resonance emission superimposed upon the underlying atmospheric Rayleigh-scattering background. OSIRIS routinely detects the OH 308 nm emission in the mesosphere from sunrise through to sunset. One feature of the OH diurnal variation is a nocturnal layer in the 80–85 km region that is frequently, but not always, detectable in solar resonance for a short period following sunrise — the feature we label here as the "sunrise flash". This paper describes the observational analysis procedures involved in the quantitative measurement of the OSIRIS OH profiles together with a broad overview of the variability of the feature at sunrise. Also included is a photochemical model simulation of the OH sunrise layer using background atmospheric parameters, especially the water vapour mixing ratio, provided by the ACE/FTS instrument on the Canadian SCISAT satellite. For a number of nearly coincident measurements between OSIRIS OH and ACE/FTS water vapour, the model simulations show general agreement between the two. Agreement is improved by modifying the eddy mixing rates in the 80–85 km region, commensurate with the expected range of mixing rates.PACS Nos.: 42.68.Ay, 82.20.Pm, 82.30.Cf, 82.33.Tb, 92.60.H–, 92.60.Ta		1

Model simulations of the CO distribution in the Southern hemisphere are performed for this period and they suggest that the emissions for this event likely originated from a nearby forest fire, after which the plume was transported from the source region to the upper troposphere. Taking advantage of the very high signal-to-noise ratio of the ACE–FTS spectra over a wide wavenumber range (750–4400 cm−1), we present in-depth analyses of the chemical composition of this plume in the middle and upper troposphere, focusing on the measurements of weakly absorbing pollutants. For this specific biomass burning event, we report simultaneous observations of an unprecedented number of organic species. Measurements of C2H4 (ethene), C3H4 (propyne), H2CO (formaldehyde), C3H6O (acetone) and CH3COO2NO2 (peroxyacetylnitrate, abbreviated as PAN) are the first reported detections using infrared occultation spectroscopy from satellites. Based on the lifetime of the emitted species, we discuss the photochemical age of the plume and also report, whenever possible, the enhancement ratios relative to CO.		1

Nevertheless, some of the values in the HITRAN database were found to be far from ideal, due to large dispersions that still exist in the experimental or theoretical methods. Therefore, new criteria were developed for introducing the best available air-broadened half-widths into HITRAN, based on physical principles and statistics. This update concerns the three most abundant isotopologues of water, with the values for H217O and H218O being the ones from analogous transitions of the principal isotopologues. The new parameters have been tested in different remote-sensing applications and improved constituent profiles were obtained. In total, air-broadened half-width values were updated for 11,787 transitions of water vapor in the HITRAN database (6789 for H216O, 2906 for H217O, and 2092 for H218O). Some additional updates to the water-vapor line list are also presented. The resultant file (01_hit06.par) was uploaded to the HITRAN website (http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/) in September 2006.		1

ACE provides the first comprehensive data set for the investigation of interhemispheric, interseasonal, and height-resolved differences of the O3-N2O correlation structure. By subsampling the CMAM data, the representativeness of the ACE data is evaluated. In the middle stratosphere, where the correlations are not compact and therefore mainly reflect the data sampling, joint probability density functions provide a detailed picture of key aspects of transport and mixing, but also trace polar ozone loss. CMAM captures these important features, but exhibits a displacement of the tropical pipe into the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Below about 21 km, the ACE data generally confirm the compactness of the correlations, although chemical ozone loss tends to destroy the compactness during late winter/spring, especially in the SH. This allows a quantitative comparison of the correlation slopes in the lower and lowermost stratosphere (LMS), which exhibit distinct seasonal cycles that reveal the different balances between diabatic descent and horizontal mixing in these two regions in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), reconciling differences found in aircraft measurements, and the strong role of chemical ozone loss in the SH. The seasonal cycles are qualitatively well reproduced by CMAM, although their amplitude is too weak in the NH LMS. The correlation slopes allow a “chemical” definition of the LMS, which is found to vary substantially in vertical extent with season.		1

The ozone mixing ratio profiles from MAESTRO and ozonesondes agree within about 5–10% from 16–30 km in the northern middle and high latitudes. Further, ACE-FTS and MAESTRO ozone profiles agree within ∼5–15% from 16–50 km. MAESTRO ozone profiles show a systematic bias which is opposite for sunrise (SR) and sunset (SS) events and was also seen in comparisons with SAGE III and POAM III ozone. MAESTRO SS ozone profiles mostly agree within 5–10% from 16–40 km with either SAGE III or POAM III SR or SS retrievals, but show a significant high bias from 40–55 km, reaching a maximum of ∼20–30%. MAESTRO SR ozone profiles show a low bias of ∼5–15% from 20–50 km, as compared to SAGE III and POAM III SR or SS measurements. The NO2 profiles agree within about 10–15% between ACE-FTS and MAESTRO from 15–40 km for the SR and 22–35 km for the SS measurements. Further, MAESTRO NO2 profiles agree with SAGE III NO2 mostly within 10% from 25–40 km. MAESTRO NO2 profiles agree with POAM III SR profiles within 5–10% from 25–42 km. However, compared to POAM III SS profiles, MAESTRO NO2 profiles show a low bias between 20 and 25 km (∼30–50%), a high MAESTRO bias between 25 and 32 km (10–30%), and again a low bias above 33 km that increases with altitude to 50–60%.		1

A neural network is first used to account for inter-instrument biases in HCl observations. A second neural network is used to learn the abundance of Cly as a function of HCl and CH4, and to form a time series using available HCl and CH4 measurements. The estimates of Cly are broadly consistent with calculations based on tracer fractional releases and previous estimates of stratospheric age of air. These new estimates of Cly provide a critical test for global models, which exhibit significant differences in predicted Cly and ozone recovery.		1

In the UTLS, validation of chemical trace gas measurements is a challenging task due to small-scale variability in the tracer fields, strong gradients of the tracers across the tropopause, and scarcity of measurements suitable for validation purposes. Validation based on coincidences therefore suffers from geophysical noise. Two alternative methods for the validation of satellite data are introduced, which avoid the usual need for coincident measurements: tracer-tracer correlations, and vertical tracer profiles relative to tropopause height. Both are increasingly being used for model validation as they strongly suppress geophysical variability and thereby provide an "instantaneous climatology". This allows comparison of measurements between non-coincident data sets which yields information about the precision and a statistically meaningful error-assessment of the ACE-FTS satellite data in the UTLS. By defining a trade-off factor, we show that the measurement errors can be reduced by including more measurements obtained over a wider longitude range into the comparison, despite the increased geophysical variability. Applying the methods then yields the following upper bounds to the relative differences in the mean found between the ACE-FTS and SPURT aircraft measurements in the upper troposphere (UT) and lower stratosphere (LS), respectively: for CO ±9% and ±12%, for H2O ±30% and ±18%, and for O3 ±25% and ±19%. The relative differences for O3 can be narrowed down by using a larger dataset obtained from ozonesondes, yielding a high bias in the ACE-FTS measurements of 18% in the UT and relative differences of ±8% for measurements in the LS. When taking into account the smearing effect of the vertically limited spacing between measurements of the ACE-FTS instrument, the relative differences decrease by 5–15% around the tropopause, suggesting a vertical resolution of the ACE-FTS in the UTLS of around 1 km. The ACE-FTS hence offers unprecedented precision and vertical resolution for a satellite instrument, which will allow a new global perspective on UTLS tracer distributions.		1

Methane is one of the key species. The version v2.2 data of the ACE-FTS CH4 data have been compared to correlative satellite, balloon-borne and ground-based Fourier transform infrared remote sensing data to assess their quality. The comparison results indicate that the accuracy of the data is within 10% in the upper troposphere – lower stratosphere, and within 25% in the middle and higher stratosphere up to the lower mesosphere (<60 km). The observed differences are generally consistent with reported systematic uncertainties. ACE-FTS is also shown to reproduce the variability of methane in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere.		1

The system is surrounded by an enigmatic bipolar nebula, which might have been shaped by episodic mass-loss events, possibly triggered by dynamical interactions between the companion and the circumprimary disk. In this paper, we investigate the spatial structure and kinematics of the circumprimary disk, with the aim to obtain new insights into the still strongly debated evolutionary stage. For this purpose, we combine, for the first time, infrared spectro-interferometry (VLTI/AMBER, λ/Δλ = 12, 000) and spectro-astrometry (VLT/CRIRES, λ/Δλ = 100, 000), which allows us to study the AU-scale distribution of circumstellar gas and dust with an unprecedented velocity resolution of 3 km s –1 . Using a model-independent photocenter analysis technique, we find that the Brγ-line-emitting gas rotates in the same plane as the dust disk. We can reproduce the wavelength-differential visibilities and phases and the double-peaked line profile using a Keplerian-rotating disk model. The derived mass of the central star is 5.4 ± 0.4 M ☉ · ( d /1150 pc), which is considerably lower than expected from the spectral classification, suggesting that V921 Sco might be more distant ( d ~ 2 kpc) than commonly assumed. Using the geometric information provided by our Brγ spectro-interferometric data and Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund line decrement measurements in 61 hydrogen recombination line transitions, we derive the density of the line-emitting gas ( N e = (2-6) × 10 19 m –3 ). Given that our measurements can be reproduced with a Keplerian velocity field without an outflowing velocity component and the non-detection of age-indicating spectroscopic diagnostics, our study provides new evidence for the pre-main-sequence nature of V921 Sco.		1

These have been compared with data from three models, namely the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model Data Assimilation System (CMAM-DAS), the Global Environmental Multiscale stratospheric model with the online Belgium Atmospheric CHemistry package (GEM-BACH), and the off-line 3D chemical transport model SLIMCAT to assess the total reactive nitrogen, NOy, budget above Eureka, Nunavut (80.05°N, 86.42°W). The FTIR data have been also compared with satellite measurements by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). The FTIR is able to measure four of the five primary species that form NOy: NO, NO2, HNO3, and ClONO2, while the fifth, N2O5, was obtained using the N2O5/(NO + NO2) ratio derived from the models and ACE-FTS. Combining these results, a four-year time series of NOy 15–40 km partial columns was calculated. Comparisons with each model were made, revealing mean differences (± standard error of the mean) relative to the FTIR of (−16.0 ± 0.6)%, (5.5 ± 1.0)%, and (−5.8 ± 0.4)% for CMAM-DAS, GEM-BACH, and SLIMCAT, respectively. The mean difference between the ACE-FTS and FTIR NOy partial columns was (5.6 ± 2.3)%. While we found no significant seasonal and interannual differences in the FTIR NOy stratospheric columns, the partial columns display nearly twice as much variability during the spring compared to the summer period.		1

The impacts of the various sources of systematic error are estimated by a comprehensive set of retrieval simulations. Comparisons with correlative data sets from ground-based, balloon and satellite platforms operating in the UV/visible, infrared and microwave regions of the spectrum are performed. Precision estimates are also validated, and recommendations are given on the data usage. The v2.2 H2O data have been improved over v1.5 by providing higher vertical resolution in the lower stratosphere and better precision above the stratopause. The single-profile precision is ∼0.2–0.3 ppmv (4–9%), and the vertical resolution is ∼3–4 km in the stratosphere. The precision and vertical resolution become worse with increasing height above the stratopause. Over the pressure range 0.1–0.01 hPa the precision degrades from 0.4 to 1.1 ppmv (6–34%), and the vertical resolution degrades to ∼12–16 km. The accuracy is estimated to be 0.2–0.5 ppmv (4–11%) for the pressure range 68–0.01 hPa. The scientifically useful range of the H2O data is from 316 to 0.002 hPa, although only the 82–0.002 hPa pressure range is validated here. Substantial improvement has been achieved in the v2.2 N2O data over v1.5 by reducing a significant low bias in the stratosphere and eliminating unrealistically high biased mixing ratios in the polar regions. The single-profile precision is ∼13–25 ppbv (7–38%), the vertical resolution is ∼4–6 km and the accuracy is estimated to be 3–70 ppbv (9–25%) for the pressure range 100–4.6 hPa. The scientifically useful range of the N2O data is from 100 to 1 hPa.		1

Month-to-month comparisons indicate greater seasonal variability than interannual variability between 25°S–25°N, thus comparisons are made between February, April, August, and October averages for the years 2004 and 2005 combined. The data indicate a pattern of seasonal variability which is clearer in the Northern Hemisphere tropics and a relationship between minimum temperature, minimum water vapor, and maximum HDO depletion, which exists beyond the estimated uncertainty in these values. The range of values observed for HDO depletion and comparisons to modeled Rayleigh distillation curves indicate an important contribution from convection in addition to gradual dehydration. Multiple factors including the shape of the δD profiles suggest that a likely mechanism for the convective influence is the lofting of ice particles in the tropical troposphere.		1

Profiles of total atmospheric density are derived by exploiting the constant and known mixing ratio of O2, and are used to determine profiles of pressure and temperature using hydrostatic balance and the ideal gas law. A highly accurate combined fast-line-by-line and extended correlated-k technique is implemented to fast forward model MAESTRO's O2 absorption measurements, which ensures that errors in pressure and temperature resulting from the forward model approximation are essentially negligible. Estimated errors in pressure and temperature are determined for the A-, B-, and combined A–B-band retrievals for a typical retrieval, and demonstrate that pressure profiles should be derivable to within 1% and temperature to within 2 K over most altitudes using a combined A–B retrieval. The combined retrieval provides an improvement of up to 0.25% in pressure and 0.5 K in temperature over the A-band retrieval alone. The B-band could also be used alone below about 50 km, where its independent retrieval produces error estimates of 1–1.5% in pressure and 2–3 K in temperature.		1

The COClF molecule is a temporary reservoir of both chlorine and fluorine and has not been measured previously by remote sensing. A maximum COClF mixing ratio of 99.7±48.0pptv (10-12 per unit volume, 1 sigma) is measured at 28 km for tropical and subtropical occultations (latitudes below 20∘ in both hemispheres) with lower mixing ratios at both higher and lower altitudes. Northern hemisphere mid-latitude mixing ratios (30–50°N) resulted in an average profile with a peak mixing ratio of 51.7±32.1pptv, 1 sigma, at 27 km, also decreasing above and below that altitude. We compare the measured average profiles with the one reported set of in situ lower stratospheric mid-latitude measurements from 1986 and 1987, a previous two-dimensional (2-D) model calculation for 1987 and 1993, and a 2-D-model prediction for 2004. The measured average tropical profile is in close agreement with the model prediction; the northern mid-latitude profile is also consistent, although the peak in the measured profile occurs at a higher altitude (2.5–4.5 km offset) than in the model prediction. Seasonal average 2-D-model predictions of the COClF stratospheric distribution for 2004 are also reported.		1

Mixing ratios as high as 1.7 ppbv (1 ppbv=1×10−9 per unit volume) were measured in the subtropical troposphere. Back trajectories, fire count statistics, and simultaneous measurements of other species from the same occultation provide evidence that the elevated H2O2 mixing ratios originated from a young biomass-burning plume. The ACE time series show only a few cases with elevated H2O2 mixing ratios likely because of the short lifetime of H2O2 and the limited sampling during biomass-burning time periods.		1

We describe these measurements and validate them by demonstrating their internal consistency and by comparing them to other remotely sounded measurements and to 2-D model simulations. Comparisons with other measurements suggest that MLS has a positive bias of 25–50% in the mesosphere and a negative bias of up to 70% in the (almost CO-free) lower stratosphere. The geophysical features observed in the MLS CO field show excellent qualitative agreement with other measurements.		1

As part of the Canadian Arctic Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) validation campaign, the PARIS-IR instrument recorded solar absorption spectra of the atmosphere from February to March 2004 as the Sun returned to the Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Observatory (AStrO) near Eureka, Nunavut, Canada (80.05°N, 86.42°W). In this paper, we briefly outline the PARIS-IR instrument configuration and data acquisition in the high Arctic. We discuss the retrieval methodology, characterization and error analysis associated with total and partial column retrievals. We compare the PARIS-IR measurements of N2O and O3 column amounts with those from the Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) onboard the Canadian SCISAT-1 satellite and the ozonesonde data obtained at Eureka during the validation campaign.		1

Enhancement ratios and emission factors for HCOOH, CH3OH, HCN, C2H6, and OCS relative to CO at 250–350 hPa are inferred from measurements of young plumes compared with lower mixing ratios assumed to represent background conditions based on a CO emission factor derived from boreal measurements. Results are generally consistent with the limited data reported for various vegetative types and emission phases measured in extratropical forests including boreal forests. The low correlation between fire product emission mixing ratios and the SF6 mixing ratio is consistent with no significant SF6 emissions from the biomass fires.		1

At issue in particular is the reliability of models for simulating the loss under variable dynamical conditions in the Arctic region. This paper describes inferred O3 loss calculations for the 2004–2005 Arctic winter using data from four solar occultation satellite instruments, as well as the Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder (EOS MLS). O3 loss is quantified with the “Chemical Transport Model (CTM) passive subtraction” approach, using a passive O3 tracer field from the SLIMCAT CTM. The 2004–2005 Arctic winter was moderately active dynamically, but was still one of the coldest Arctic winters on record, with prime conditions for O3 loss. Loss estimates inferred from all of the different satellite instruments peaked in mid-March at 450 K between 2–2.3 ppmv, slightly less than similar estimations for the cold 1999–2000 winter. The SLIMCAT CTM was also used to simulate O3 for the 2004–2005 winter. In March, near 450 K, the model O3 was 0.3 ppmv (∼10–15%) lower than the observations, leading to a maximum O3 loss that was 10–15% larger than that inferred from observations, using the passive subtraction approach. Modeled loss maximized around the same time as that inferred from observations. Although some discrepancies between the observed and modeled O3 remain, the level of agreement presented here shows that the SLIMCAT CTM was able to satisfactorily simulate O3 and polar O3 loss during the dynamically active 2004–2005 Arctic winter.		1

This paper presents the chemistry affecting both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone with an emphasis on the stratosphere. In the decade since the last Environment Canada report on stratospheric ozone (Wardle et al. , 1997) there have been many advances in our understanding. Recent studies have shown that inorganic chlorine, which is the main contributor to polar ozone depletion and middle stratospheric ozone reduction, has started to decrease as a result of the implementation of the Montreal Protocol. During this period, Canada launched a small satellite, SCISAT‐1. We discuss the chemical processes related to polar ozone loss, such as chlorine activation and denitrification, using data from SCISAT‐1. These measurements and those from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on the Aura satellite confirm that the chlorine deactivation in the Arctic is distinct from that in the Antarctic. Recent studies show that our understanding of the middle atmosphere bromine budget needs improvement. Using measured constraints reproduces the polar and extra‐polar ozone loss better. In addition, recent studies have addressed the variation of middle atmosphere ozone with solar variability. These studies have investigated the variation of solar radiation and related energetic particle precipitation (EPP) such as auroral precipitation, solar proton events (SPEs) as well as cosmic rays. Although there was some appreciation of these effects in the past, current three‐dimensional (3‐D) models suggest that the EPP may have a greater effect on middle atmospheric ozone than was previously realized. Stratospheric ozone loss allows the penetration of more ultraviolet (UV) radiation into the lower atmosphere, and thus may result in an increase in the oxidation state of the troposphere and affect tropospheric chemistry. Quantitative assessment of the effect of lightning on the ozone budget of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is a current challenge, while increases in the size of commercial aviation fleets have a positive radiative forcing in this region. To include the feedbacks between radiation, chemistry and dynamics associated with atmospheric change, coupled chemistry‐climate models (CCMs) have been developed during the past decade. While these models still require improvement in transport and physical processes they generally predict that the Antarctic ozone layer will recover to the levels prior to 1980 by the middle of this century as a result of decreasing atmospheric chlorine and a cooling stratosphere. According to a recent semi‐empirical relationship between ozone loss and Arctic meteorological conditions (Rex et al. , 2004), a colder Arctic stratosphere may result in more severe ozone loss in the boreal springtime in the near future.		1

However, comparisons of the chemistry climate models used in the latest international assessment of stratospheric ozone depletion have shown large differences in the modeled Cly, with these differences explaining many of the differences in the simulated evolution of ozone over the next century. Here in, we examine the role of transport in determining the simulated Cly using three simulations from the same off-line chemical transport model that have the same lower tropospheric boundary conditions and the same chemical solver, but differing resolution and/or meteorological fields. These simulations show that transport plays a key role in determining the Cly distribution, and that Cly depends on both the time scales and pathways of transport. The time air spends in the stratosphere (e.g., the mean age) is an important transport factor determining stratospheric Cly, but the relationship between mean age and Cly is not simple. Lower stratospheric Cly depends on the fraction of air that has been in the upper stratosphere, and transport differences between models having the same mean age can result in differences in the fraction of organic chlorine converted into Cly. Differences in transport pathways result in differences in vertical profiles of CFCs, and comparisons of observed and modeled CFC profiles provide a stringent test of transport pathways in models.		1

Within the MIPAS validation activities, independent observations from balloons, aircraft, satellites, and ground-based stations have been compared to European Space Agency (ESA) version 4.61 operational H2O data comprising the time period from July 2002 until March 2004 where MIPAS measured with full spectral resolution. No significant bias in the MIPAS H2O data is seen in the lower stratosphere (above the hygropause) between about 15 and 30 km. Differences of H2O quantities observed by MIPAS and the validation instruments are mostly well within the combined total errors in this altitude region. In the upper stratosphere (above about 30 km), a tendency towards a small positive bias (up to about 10%) is present in the MIPAS data when compared to its balloon-borne counterpart MIPAS-B, to the satellite instruments HALOE (Halogen Occultation Experiment) and ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment, Fourier Transform Spectrometer), and to the millimeter-wave airborne sensor AMSOS (Airborne Microwave Stratospheric Observing System). In the mesosphere the situation is unclear due to the occurrence of different biases when comparing HALOE and ACE-FTS data. Pronounced deviations between MIPAS and the correlative instruments occur in the lowermost stratosphere and upper troposphere, a region where retrievals of H2O are most challenging. Altogether it can be concluded that MIPAS H2O profiles yield valuable information on the vertical distribution of H2O in the stratosphere with an overall accuracy of about 10 to 30% and a precision of typically 5 to 15% – well within the predicted error budget, showing that these global and continuous data are very valuable for scientific studies. However, in the region around the tropopause retrieved MIPAS H2O profiles are less reliable, suffering from a number of obstacles such as retrieval boundary and cloud effects, sharp vertical discontinuities, and frequent horizontal gradients in both temperature and H2O volume mixing ratio (VMR). Some profiles are characterized by retrieval instabilities.		1

Carbon monoxide (CO), a good tracer of pollution plumes and atmospheric dynamics, is one of the key species provided by the primary instrument, the ACE-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). This instrument performs measurements in both the CO 1-0 and 2-0 ro-vibrational bands, from which vertically resolved CO concentration profiles are retrieved, from the mid-troposphere to the thermosphere. This paper presents an updated description of the ACE-FTS version 2.2 CO data product, along with a comprehensive validation of these profiles using available observations (February 2004 to December 2006). We have compared the CO partial columns with ground-based measurements using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and millimeter wave radiometry, and the volume mixing ratio profiles with airborne (both high-altitude balloon flight and airplane) observations. CO satellite observations provided by nadir-looking instruments (MOPITT and TES) as well as limb-viewing remote sensors (MIPAS, SMR and MLS) were also compared with the ACE-FTS CO products. We show that the ACE-FTS measurements provide CO profiles with small retrieval errors (better than 5% from the upper troposphere to 40 km, and better than 10% above). These observations agree well with the correlative measurements, considering the rather loose coincidence criteria in some cases. Based on the validation exercise we assess the following uncertainties to the ACE-FTS measurement data: better than 15% in the upper troposphere (8–12 km), than 30% in the lower stratosphere (12–30 km), and than 25% from 30 to 100 km.		1

Canadian Arctic Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) Validation Campaigns were conducted at Eureka (80° N, 86° W) during each of these winters. New satellite measurements from ACE-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER), and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), along with meteorological analyses and Eureka lidar temperatures, are used to detail the meteorology in these winters, to demonstrate its influence on transport, and to provide a context for interpretation of ACE-FTS and validation campaign observations. During the 2004 and 2006 SSWs, the vortex broke down throughout the stratosphere, reformed quickly in the upper stratosphere, and remained weak in the middle and lower stratosphere. The stratopause reformed at very high altitude, near 75 km. ACE measurements covered both vortex and extra-vortex conditions in each winter, except in late-February through mid-March 2004 and 2006, when the strong, pole-centered vortex that reformed after the SSWs resulted in ACE sampling only inside the vortex in the middle through upper stratosphere. The 2004 and 2006 Eureka campaigns were during the recovery from the SSWs, with the redeveloping vortex over Eureka. 2005 was the coldest winter on record in the lower stratosphere, but with an early final warming in mid-March. The vortex was over Eureka at the start of the 2005 campaign, but moved away as it broke up. Disparate temperature profile structure and vortex evolution resulted in much lower (higher) temperatures in the upper (lower) stratosphere in 2004 and 2006 than in 2005. Satellite temperatures agree well with lidar data up to 50–60 km, and ACE-FTS, MLS and SABER show good agreement in high-latitude temperatures throughout the winters. Consistent with a strong, cold upper stratospheric vortex and enhanced radiative cooling after the SSWs, MLS and ACE-FTS trace gas measurements show strongly enhanced descent in the upper stratospheric vortex in late January through March 2006 compared to that in 2005.		1

This is of note because the level of EPP in the preceding months was very low, suggesting that excess production of NOx was not the cause of the enhancements. Rather, the enhancements are attributed to unusually strong descent in the middle atmosphere. This is the third time on record that extraordinary meteorology contributed to descent of excess NOx. The results confirm that EPP impacts on the middle atmosphere can be large even in the absence of exceptional EPP, and highlight the need to continually measure NOx throughout the polar region from the stratosphere to the lower thermosphere.		1

A total of 28 spectra, 16 self-broadened and 12 air-broadened, recorded using high-purity (≥99.5% 12C-enriched) CO samples and CO diluted with dry air (research grade) at different temperatures and pressures, were analyzed simultaneously to maximize the accuracy of the retrieved parameters. The sample temperatures ranged from 150 to 298 K and the total pressures varied between 5 and 700 Torr. A multispectrum nonlinear least squares spectrum fitting technique was used to adjust the rovibrational constants (G, B, D, etc.) and intensity parameters (including Herman–Wallis coefficients), rather than determining individual line positions and intensities. Self- and air-broadened Lorentz half-width coefficients, their temperature dependence exponents, self- and air-pressure-induced shift coefficients, their temperature dependences, self- and air- line mixing coefficients, their temperature dependences and speed dependence have been retrieved from the analysis. Speed-dependent line shapes with line mixing employing off-diagonal relaxation matrix element formalism were needed to minimize the fit residuals. This study presents a precise and complete set of spectral line parameters that consistently reproduce the spectrum of carbon monoxide over terrestrial atmospheric conditions.		1

The MIPAS measurements were validated regarding any potential biases of the profiles, and with respect to their precision estimates. The MOHAVE-2009 measurement campaign provided measurements of atmospheric profiles of temperature, water vapor/relative humidity, and ozone from the ground to the mesosphere by a suite of instruments including radiosondes, ozonesondes, frost point hygrometers, lidars, microwave radiometers and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrometers. For MIPAS temperatures (version V4O_T_204), no significant bias was detected in the middle stratosphere; between 22 km and the tropopause MIPAS temperatures were found to be biased low by up to 2 K, while below the tropopause, they were found to be too high by the same amount. These findings confirm earlier comparisons of MIPAS temperatures to ECMWF data which revealed similar differences. Above 12 km up to 45 km, MIPAS water vapor (version V4O_H2O_203) is well within 10% of the data of all correlative instruments. The well-known dry bias of MIPAS water vapor above 50 km due to neglect of non-LTE effects in the current retrievals has been confirmed. Some instruments indicate that MIPAS water vapor might be biased high by 20 to 40% around 10 km (or 5 km below the tropopause), but a consistent picture from all comparisons could not be derived. MIPAS ozone (version V4O_O3_202) has a high bias of up to +0.9 ppmv around 37 km which is due to a non-identified continuum like radiance contribution. No further significant biases have been detected. Cross-comparison to co-located observations of other satellite instruments (Aura/MLS, ACE-FTS, AIRS) is provided as well.		1

Here we compare the latest ozone data products from ACE-FTS and ACE-MAESTRO with coincident observations from nearly 20 satellite-borne, airborne, balloon-borne and ground-based instruments, by analysing volume mixing ratio profiles and partial column densities. The ACE-FTS version 2.2 Ozone Update product reports more ozone than most correlative measurements from the upper troposphere to the lower mesosphere. At altitude levels from 16 to 44 km, the average values of the mean relative differences are nearly all within +1 to +8%. At higher altitudes (45–60 km), the ACE-FTS ozone amounts are significantly larger than those of the comparison instruments, with mean relative differences of up to +40% (about +20% on average). For the ACE-MAESTRO version 1.2 ozone data product, mean relative differences are within ±10% (average values within ±6%) between 18 and 40 km for both the sunrise and sunset measurements. At higher altitudes (~35–55 km), systematic biases of opposite sign are found between the ACE-MAESTRO sunrise and sunset observations. While ozone amounts derived from the ACE-MAESTRO sunrise occultation data are often smaller than the coincident observations (with mean relative differences down to −10%), the sunset occultation profiles for ACE-MAESTRO show results that are qualitatively similar to ACE-FTS, indicating a large positive bias (mean relative differences within +10 to +30%) in the 45–55 km altitude range. In contrast, there is no significant systematic difference in bias found for the ACE-FTS sunrise and sunset measurements.		1

Two of the ten instruments involved in the campaign, both Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs), were operated simultaneously, recording atmospheric solar absorption spectra. The first instrument was an ABB Bomem DA8 high-resolution infrared FTS. The second instrument was the Portable Atmospheric Research Interferometric Spectrometer for the Infrared (PARIS-IR), the ground-based version of the satellite-borne FTS on the ACE satellite (ACE-FTS). From the measurements collected by these two ground-based instruments, total column densities of seven stratospheric trace gases (O3, HCl, ClONO2, HF, HNO3, NO2, and NO) were retrieved using the optimal estimation method and these results were compared. Since the two instruments sampled the same portions of atmosphere by synchronizing observations during the campaign and used consistent retrieval parameters, the biases in retrieved columns from the two spectrometers represent the instrumental differences. Mean differences in total column densities of O3, HCl, ClONO2, HF, HNO3, and NO2 from the observations between PARIS-IR and the DA8 FTS are 2.8 %, −3.2 %, −4.3 %, −1.5 %, −1.9 %, and −0.1 %, respectively. Partial column results from the ground-based spectrometers were also compared with partial columns derived from ACE-FTS version 2.2 (including updates for O3) profiles. Mean differences in partial column densities of O3, HCl, ClONO2, HF, HNO3, NO2, and NO from the measurements between ACE-FTS and the DA8 FTS are −5.9 %, −8.5 %, −11.8 %, −0.9 %, −6.6 %, −21.6 % and −7.6 % respectively. Mean differences in partial column densities of O3, HCl, ClONO2, HF, HNO3, NO2 from the measurements between ACE-FTS and the PARIS-IR are −5.2 %, −4.6 %, −2.3 %, −4.7 %, 5.7 % and −11.9 %, respectively. This work provides further evidence of the reliability of ACE-FTS measurements from the first three years of on-orbit observations. Column densities of O3, HCl, ClONO2, and HNO3 from the three FTSs were normalized with respect to HF and used to compare the time evolution of the chemical constituents in the atmosphere over Eureka during spring 2006.		1

Since then, it has delivered high quality spectra of the atmosphere of Venus. Spectra are recorded in the IR spectral region (2.2–4.3 μm) using the solar occultation geometry and give access to a vast number of ro-vibrational lines and bands of several key species of the atmosphere of Venus. Here we present the retrieval strategy applied to obtain high quality vertical profiles of carbon monoxide (CO) densities and volume mixing ratios (vmr), spanning the 65–150 km altitude range. We discuss the methodology used to derive the profiles and the validation process implemented to ensure the quality and reproducibility of the results. Influence of ancillary data, such as temperature, is discussed. High variability of CO densities and vmr is observed in relatively short term periods. Correlation between CO and CO2 densities, as well as between CO and temperature above 110 km, corroborates that the major process at those altitudes is the photodissociation of CO2 into CO.		1

Water vapour (H2O), one of the most important molecules for climate and atmospheric chemistry, is one of the key species provided by the two principal instruments, the infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and the MAESTRO UV-Visible spectrometer (ACE-MAESTRO). The first instrument performs measurements on several lines in the 1362–2137 cm−1 range, from which vertically resolved H2O concentration profiles are retrieved, from 7 to 90 km altitude. ACE-MAESTRO measures profiles using the water absorption band in the near infrared part of the spectrum at 926.0–969.7 nm. This paper presents a comprehensive validation of the ACE-FTS profiles. We have compared the H2O volume mixing ratio profiles with space-borne (SAGE II, HALOE, POAM III, MIPAS, SMR) observations and measurements from balloon-borne frostpoint hygrometers and a ground based lidar. We show that the ACE-FTS measurements provide H2O profiles with small retrieval uncertainties in the stratosphere (better than 5% from 15 to 70 km, gradually increasing above). The situation is unclear in the upper troposphere, due mainly to the high variability of the water vapour volume mixing ratio in this region. A new water vapour data product from the ACE-MAESTRO (Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation) is also presented and initial comparisons with ACE-FTS are discussed.		1

One of these instruments, the ACE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), is measuring volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles of nitrous oxide (N2O) from the upper troposphere to the lower mesosphere at a vertical resolution of about 3–4 km. In this study, the quality of the ACE-FTS version 2.2 N2O data is assessed through comparisons with coincident measurements made by other satellite, balloon-borne, aircraft, and ground-based instruments. These consist of vertical profile comparisons with the SMR, MLS, and MIPAS satellite instruments, multiple aircraft flights of ASUR, and single balloon flights of SPIRALE and FIRS-2, and partial column comparisons with a network of ground-based Fourier Transform InfraRed spectrometers (FTIRs). Between 6 and 30 km, the mean absolute differences for the satellite comparisons lie between −42 ppbv and +17 ppbv, with most within ±20 ppbv. This corresponds to relative deviations from the mean that are within ±15%, except for comparisons with MIPAS near 30 km, for which they are as large as 22.5%. Between 18 and 30 km, the mean absolute differences for the satellite comparisons are generally within ±10 ppbv. From 30 to 60 km, the mean absolute differences are within ±4 ppbv, and are mostly between −2 and +1 ppbv. Given the small N2O VMR in this region, the relative deviations from the mean are therefore large at these altitudes, with most suggesting a negative bias in the ACE-FTS data between 30 and 50 km. In the comparisons with the FTIRs, the mean relative differences between the ACE-FTS and FTIR partial columns (which cover a mean altitude range of 14 to 27 km) are within ±5.6% for eleven of the twelve contributing stations. This mean relative difference is negative at ten stations, suggesting a small negative bias in the ACE-FTS partial columns over the altitude regions compared. Excellent correlation (R=0.964) is observed between the ACE-FTS and FTIR partial columns, with a slope of 1.01 and an intercept of −0.20 on the line fitted to the data.		1

This work presents results from two FTIR measurement campaigns in 2002 and 2004, held at Ile de La Réunion (21° S, 55° E). These campaigns represent the first FTIR observations carried out at a southern (sub)tropical site. They serve the initiation of regular, long-term FTIR monitoring at this site in the near future. To demonstrate the capabilities of the FTIR measurements at this location for tropospheric and stratospheric monitoring, a detailed report is given on the retrieval strategy, information content and corresponding full error budget evaluation for ozone (O3), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), ethane (C2H6), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and nitric acid (HNO3) total and partial column retrievals. Moreover, we have made a thorough comparison of the capabilities at sea level altitude (St.-Denis) and at 2200 m a.s.l. (Maïdo). It is proved that the performances of the technique are such that the atmospheric variability can be observed, at both locations and in distinct altitude layers. Comparisons with literature and with correlative data from ozone sonde and satellite (i.e., ACE-FTS, HALOE and MOPITT) measurements are given to confirm the results. Despite the short time series available at present, we have been able to detect the seasonal variation of CO in the biomass burning season, as well as the impact of particular biomass burning events in Africa and Madagascar on the atmospheric composition above Ile de La Réunion. We also show that differential measurements between St.-Denis and Maïdo provide useful information about the concentrations in the boundary layer.		1

In this paper, the quality of the ACE-FTS version 2.2 NO2 and NO and the MAESTRO version 1.2 NO2 data are assessed using other solar occultation measurements (HALOE, SAGE II, SAGE III, POAM III, SCIAMACHY), stellar occultation measurements (GOMOS), limb measurements (MIPAS, OSIRIS), nadir measurements (SCIAMACHY), balloon-borne measurements (SPIRALE, SAOZ) and ground-based measurements (UV-VIS, FTIR). Time differences between the comparison measurements were reduced using either a tight coincidence criterion, or where possible, chemical box models. ACE-FTS NO2 and NO and the MAESTRO NO2 are generally consistent with the correlative data. The ACE-FTS and MAESTRO NO2 volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles agree with the profiles from other satellite data sets to within about 20% between 25 and 40 km, with the exception of MIPAS ESA (for ACE-FTS) and SAGE II (for ACE-FTS (sunrise) and MAESTRO) and suggest a negative bias between 23 and 40 km of about 10%. MAESTRO reports larger VMR values than the ACE-FTS. In comparisons with HALOE, ACE-FTS NO VMRs typically (on average) agree to ±8% from 22 to 64 km and to +10% from 93 to 105 km, with maxima of 21% and 36%, respectively. Partial column comparisons for NO2 show that there is quite good agreement between the ACE instruments and the FTIRs, with a mean difference of +7.3% for ACE-FTS and +12.8% for MAESTRO.		1

We observe high OCS mixing ratios (>400 pptv) within the tropical stratosphere owing to convected tropospheric air. Stratospheric mixing ratios decrease more rapidly with altitude moving away from the Equator, creating a poleward gradient. Elevated OCS concentrations observed at low southern latitudes are consistent with a significant pyrogenic source. Using coincident ACE measurements of CFC-11 and CFC-12 we determine a global OCS stratospheric lifetime of 64 ± 21 years corresponding to a stratospheric sink of 63–124 Gg OCS yr−1.		1

The agreement of ACE-FTS temperatures with other sensors is typically better than 2 K in the stratosphere and upper troposphere and 5 K in the lower mesosphere. There is evidence of a systematic high bias (roughly 3–6 K) in the ACE-FTS temperatures in the mesosphere, and a possible systematic low bias (roughly 2 K) in ACE-FTS temperatures near 23 km. Some ACE-FTS temperature profiles exhibit unphysical oscillations, a problem fixed in preliminary comparisons with temperatures derived using the next version of the ACE-FTS retrieval software. Though these relatively large oscillations in temperature can be on the order of 10 K in the mesosphere, retrieved volume mixing ratio profiles typically vary by less than a percent or so. Statistical comparisons suggest these oscillations occur in about 10% of the retrieved profiles. Analysis from a set of coincident lidar measurements suggests that the random error in ACE-FTS version 2.2 temperatures has a lower limit of about ±2 K.		1

The HCFC-142b molecule is currently the third most abundant HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocarbon) in the atmosphere and ACE measurements over this time span show a continuous rise in its volume mixing ratio. Monthly average measurements at northern and southern hemisphere mid-latitudes have similar increase rates that are consistent with surface trend measurements for a similar time span. A mean northern hemisphere profile for the time span shows a near constant VMR at 8–20 km altitude range, consistent on average for the same time span with in situ results. The nearly constant vertical VMR profile also agrees with model predictions of a long lifetime in the lower atmosphere.		1

We provide a characterization of the resolution, random and systematic uncertainties, and known issues for the version 2.2 MLS HCl data. The MLS sampling allows for comparisons with many (∼1500 to more than 3000) closely matched profiles from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). These data sets provide HCl latitudinal distributions that are, overall, very similar to those from (coincident) MLS profiles, although there are some discrepancies in the upper stratosphere between the MLS and HALOE gradients. As found in previous work, MLS and ACE HCl profiles agree very well (within ∼5%, on average), but the MLS HCl abundances are generally larger (by 10–20%) than HALOE HCl. The bias versus HALOE is unlikely to arise mostly from MLS, as a similar systematic bias (of order 15%) is not observed between average MLS and balloon-borne measurements of HCl, obtained over Fort Sumner, New Mexico, in 2004 and 2005. At the largest pressure (147 hPa) for MLS HCl, a high bias (∼0.2 ppbv) is apparent in analyses of low to midlatitude data versus in situ aircraft chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) HCl measurements from the Aura Validation Experiment (AVE) campaigns in 2004, 2005, and 2006; this bias is also observed in comparisons of MLS and aircraft HCl/O3 correlations. Good agreement between MLS and CIMS HCl is obtained at 100 to 68 hPa. The recommended pressure range for MLS HCl is from 100 to 0.15 hPa.		1

We report the observation of this effect in the mixing ratio of HCN, as measured by two satellite instruments: MLS on Aura and ACE-FTS on SCISAT-1. The cycle does not repeat every year; the data so far suggest that the dominant period is about two years. The reason for this periodicity is not yet fully understood. Comparisons with MODIS fire-count data suggest that it may be connected to inter-annual variations in biomass burning in Indonesia and the surrounding region.		1

The science objectives are the study of small-scale dynamics and transports, including stratosphere-troposphere exchange, upper troposphere/lower stratosphere chemistry, aerosol, cirrus and PSC distributions, and gravity waves. The instrument features 21 channels, low noise levels, high vertical resolution, and a mechanical cooler for long life. During launch most of the optical aperture became obscured, so that only a potion of an optical beam width at a large azimuth from the orbital plane on the side away from the Sun can see the atmosphere. Irrecoverable loss of capabilities include limitation of coverage to the region 65°S–82°N and inability to obtain longitudinal resolution finer than an orbital spacing. While this optical blockage also impacted radiometric performance, extensive effort has gone into developing corrections for the several effects of the obstruction, so that radiances from some of the channels can be put into retrievals for temperature. Changes were also necessary for the retrieval algorithm. The validation of the resulting temperature retrievals is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of these corrections. The random errors range from ∼0.5 K at 20 km to ∼1.0 at 60 km, close to those predicted. Comparisons with high-resolution radiosondes, lidars, ACE-FTS, and ECMWF analyses give a consistent picture of HIRDLS temperatures being 1–2 K warm from 200 to 10 hPa and within ±2 K of standards from 200 to 2 hPa (but warmer in the region of the tropical tropopause), above which HIRDLS appears to be cold. Comparisons show that both COSMIC and HIRDLS can see small vertical features down to about 2 km wavelength. While further improvements in the data are expected, these data will allow HIRDLS to provide important support toward reaching the Aura objectives.		1

This is illustrated by an analysis of the Asian outflow during the spring of 2005, through comparisons with simulations by the LMDz-INCA global chemistry transport model. The CO observations from the MOPITT and SCIAMACHY nadir sounders, which provide vertically integrated information with excellent horizontal sampling, and from the ACE-FTS solar occultation instrument, which has limited spatial coverage but allows the retrieval of vertical profiles, are used. Combining observations from MOPITT (mainly sensitive to the free troposphere) and SCIAMACHY (sensitive to the full column) allows a qualitative evaluation of the boundary layer CO. The model tends to underestimate this residual compared to the observations, suggesting underestimated emissions, especially in eastern Asia. However, a better understanding of the consistency and possible biases between the MOPITT and SCIAMACHY CO is necessary for a quantitative evaluation. Underestimated emissions, and possibly too low lofting and underestimated chemical production in the model, lead to an underestimate of the export to the free troposphere, as highlighted by comparisons with MOPITT and ACE-FTS. Both instruments observe large trans-Pacific transport extending from ~20° N to ~60° N, with high upper tropospheric CO observed by ACE-FTS above the eastern Pacific (with values of up to 300 ppbv around 50° N at 500 hPa and up to ~200 ppbv around 30° N at 300 hPa). The low vertical and horizontal resolutions of the global model do not allow the simulation of the strong enhancements in the observed plumes. However, the transport patterns are well captured, and are mainly attributed to export from eastern Asia, with increasing contributions from South Asia and Indonesia towards the tropics. Additional measurements of C2H2, C2H6 and HCN by ACE-FTS provide further information on the plume history. C2H2 and C2H6 enhancements are well correlated with the CO plumes, indicating common sources and rapid trans-Pacific transport. HCN observations show that the biomass burning contributes mainly at latitudes lower than ~40° N. This study provides a first step towards a full combination of complementary observations, but also highlights the need for a better evaluation of consistency between the datasets in order to allow precise quantitative analyses.		1

Ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) solar absorption observations are sensitive to a large number of biomass burning products. We present in this work the FTIR retrieval strategies, suitable for very humid sites such as Reunion Island, for hydrogen cyanide (HCN), ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), methanol (CH3OH), and formic acid (HCOOH). We provide their total columns time-series obtained from the measurements during August–October 2004, May–October 2007, and May 2009–December 2010. We show that biomass burning explains a large part of the observed seasonal and interannual variability of the chemical species. The correlations between the daily mean total columns of each of the species and those of CO, also measured with our FTIR spectrometer at Reunion Island, are very good from August to November (R ≥ 0.86). This allows us to derive, for that period, the following enhancement ratios with respect to CO: 0.0047, 0.0078, 0.0020, 0.012, and 0.0046 for HCN, C2H6, C2H2, CH3OH, and HCOOH, respectively. The HCN ground-based data are compared to the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, while the data for the other species are compared to the IMAGESv2 model. We show that using the HCN/CO ratio derived from our measurements (0.0047) in GEOS-Chem reduces the underestimation of the modeled HCN columns compared with the FTIR measurements. The comparisons between IMAGESv2 and the long-lived species C2H6 and C2H2 indicate that the biomass burning emissions used in the model (from the GFED3 inventory) are probably underestimated in the late September–October period for all years of measurements, and especially in 2004. The comparisons with the short-lived species, CH3OH and HCOOH, with lifetimes of around 5 days, suggest that the emission underestimation in late September–October 2004, occurs more specifically in the Southeastern Africa-Madagascar region. The very good correlation of CH3OH and HCOOH with CO suggests that, despite the dominance of the biogenic source of these compounds on the global scale, biomass burning is their major source at Reunion Island between August and November.		1

The parameterizations for heterogeneous chemistry on liquid aerosols are most sensitive to temperature with the reaction rates doubling for every 1 K increase in temperature. However, differences between the currently available parameterizations are negligible. For Nitric Acid Trihydrate particles (NAT) the major factors of uncertainty are the number density of nucleated particles and different parameterizations for heterogeneous chemistry. These two factors induce an uncertainty that covers several orders of magnitude on the reaction rate. Nonetheless, since predicted reaction rates on liquid aerosols always exceed those on NAT, the overall uncertainty for chlorine activation is small. In-situ observations of ClOx from Arctic winters in 2005 and 2010 are used to evaluate the heterogeneous chemistry parameterizations. The conditions for these measurements proved to be very different between those two winters with HCl being the limiting reacting partner for the 2005 measurements and ClONO2 for the 2010 measurements. Modeled levels of chlorine activation are in very good agreement with the in-situ observations and the surface area provided by Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs) has only a limited impact on modeled chlorine activation. This indicates that the parameterizations give a good representation of the processes in the atmosphere. Back-trajectories started on the location of the observations in 2005 indicate temperatures on the threshold for PSC formation, hence the surface area is mainly provided by the background aerosol. Still, the model shows additional chlorine activation during this time-frame, providing cautionary evidence for chlorine activation even in the absence of PSCs. Vortex-averaged satellite observations by the MLS instrument also show no definite connection between chlorine activation and PSC formation. The inter -and intra-annual variability of vortex-average HCl and HNO3 based on MLS observations is examined for the Arctic winters 2004/2005 to 2010/2011. These observations show that removal of HCl and HNO3 from the gas-phase are not correlated. HNO3 loss exhibits great inter-annual variability depending on prevailing temperatures while HCl loss is continuous through December without considerable inter- or intra-annual variability. Only the recovery of HCl in late winter depends on the level of denitrification. Hence, the occurrence of HNO3 containing PSC particles does not seem to have a significant effect on the speed of initial chlorine activation on a vortex-wide scale.		1

A large visual obstruction blocking over 80% of the HIRDLS field of view presents significant challenges to the data analysis methods and implementation, to the extent that the radiative properties of the obstruction must be accurately characterized in order to adequately correct measured radiances. The radiance correction algorithms updated as of August 2007 are used in the HIRDLS v2.04.09 data presented here. Comparisons indicate that HIRDLS ozone is recoverable between 1 and 100 hPa at middle and high latitudes and between 1 and 50 hPa at low latitudes. Accuracy of better than 10% is indicated between 1 and 30 hPa (HIRDLS generally low) by the majority of the comparisons with coincident measurements, and 5% is indicated between 2 and 10 hPa when compared with some lidars. Between 50 and 100 hPa, at middle and high latitudes, accuracy is 10–20%. The ozone precision is estimated to be generally 5–10% between 1 and 50 hPa. Comparisons with ozonesondes and lidars give strong indication that HIRDLS is capable of resolving fine vertical ozone features (1–2 km) in the region between 1 and 50 hPa. Development is continuing on the radiance correction and the cloud detection and filtering algorithms, and it is hoped that it will be possible to achieve a further reduction in the systematic bias and an increase in the measurement range downward to lower heights (at pressures greater than 50–100 hPa).		1

Carbon monoxide (CO) shows a broad maximum over the monsoon anticyclone region in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS); these enhanced CO values are associated with air pollution transported upward by convection, and confined by the strong anticyclonic circulation. Profiles inside the anticyclone show enhancement of tropospheric tracers CO, HCN, C2H6, and C2H2 between ~12 to 20 km, with maxima near 13–15 km. Strong correlations are observed among constituents, consistent with sources from near-surface pollution and biomass burning. Stratospheric tracers (O3, HNO3 and HCl) exhibit decreased values inside the anticyclone between ~12–20 km. These observations are further evidence of transport of lower tropospheric air into the UTLS region, and isolation of air within the anticyclone. The relative enhancements of tropospheric species inside the anticyclone are closely related to the photochemical lifetime of the species, with strongest enhancement for shorter lived species. Vertical profiles of the ratio of C2H2/CO (used to measure the relative age of air) suggest relatively rapid transport of fresh emissions up to the tropopause level inside the anticyclone.		1

Between 1998 and 2004 the stratospheric loading of HCl was relatively constant, with some month to month fluctuation; this was followed by a more pronounced decrease in HCl since 2004. We use probability distribution functions (PDFs) and scatter diagrams for validation and bias characterization of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) HCl retrievals. Both these methods allow us to use large statistical samples and do not require correlative measurements to be colocated in space and time. The bias between the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and Aura MLS is greatest above the 525 K (∼21 km) isentropic surface. The global average mean bias between Aura and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) for January 2005 was 2% and between Aura MLS and HALOE was 14%. The widths of the PDFs are a measure of the spatial variability and measurement precision. The Aura MLS HCl PDFs are consistently wider than those for ACE and HALOE, this reflects the retrieval uncertainties. The median observation uncertainty for Aura MLS v1.51 HCl is 12%, and the median ACE v2.2 uncertainty is 8%. We also connect Aura MLS HCl with the heritage of HALOE HCl by using neural networks to learn the interinstrument biases and provide a seamless HCl record from the launch of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) in 1991 to the present.		1

To perform the simulations, we used the Global Environmental Multiscale Air Quality model (GEM-AQ), which is based on the three-dimensional global multiscale model developed by the Meteorological Service of Canada for operational weather forecasting. The model was run for the period 2004–2006 on a 1.5°×1.5° global grid with 28 hybrid vertical levels from the surface up to 10 hPa. Objective analysis data from the Canadian Meteorological Centre were used to update the meteorological fields every 24 h. Fire emission fluxes of gas species were generated by using year-specific inventories of carbon emissions with 8-day temporal resolution from the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED) version 2. The model output is compared with HCN profiles measured by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) instrument onboard the Canadian SCISAT-1 satellite. High values of up to a few ppbv are observed in the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere; the enhancement in HCN volume mixing ratios in the upper troposphere is most prominent in October. Low upper-tropospheric mixing ratios of less than 100 pptv are mostly recorded at middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere in May–July. Mixing ratios in Northern Hemisphere peak in the boreal summer. The amplitude of the seasonal variation is less pronounced than in the Southern Hemisphere. The comparison with the satellite data shows that in the upper troposphere GEM-AQ performs well globally for all seasons, except at northern high and middle latitudes in summer, where the model has a large negative bias, and in the tropics in winter and spring, where it exhibits large positive bias. This may reflect inaccurate emissions or possible inaccuracies in the emission profile. The model is able to explain most of the observed variability in the upper troposphere HCN field, including the interannual variations in the observed mixing ratio. A complementary comparison with daily total columns of HCN from two middle latitude ground-based stations in Northern Japan for the same simulation period shows that the model captures the observed seasonal variation and also points to an underestimation of model emissions in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer. The estimated average global emission equals 1.3 Tg N yr−1. The average atmospheric burden is 0.53 Tg N, and the corresponding lifetime is 4.9 months.		1

The 2-D TTL model combines the Holton and Gettelman cold trap dehydration mechanism (Holton and Gettelman, 2001) with the two column convection model of Folkins and Martin (2005). We investigate 3 possible transport scenarios through the TTL: 1) slow uniform ascent across the level of zero radiative heating without direct convective mixing, 2) convective mixing of H2O vapor at 100% relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) with no ice retention, and 3) convective mixing of extremely subsaturated air (100% RHi following the moist adiabatic temperature above the level of neutral buoyancy) with sufficient ice retention such that total H2O is 100%RHi. The three mechanisms produce similar seasonal cycles for H2O that are in good quantitative agreement with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements. We use Aura MLS measurement of CO and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer measurement of HDO to distinguish among the transport mechanisms. Model comparisons with the observations support the view that H2O is predominantly controlled by regions having the lowest cold point tropopause temperature but the trace species CO and HDO support the convective mixing of dry air and lofted ice. The model provides some insight into the processes affecting the long term trends observed in stratospheric H2O.		1

The elevated emissions were caused by intense and widespread Indonesian peat and forest fire emissions elevated compared to other years by the impact of a moderate El Niño/Soutern Oscillation (ENSO) event, which delayed that year's monsoon season and produced very dry conditions. Moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) fire counts, atmospheric chemistry experiment (ACE) measurements of elevated mixing ratios of fire emission products and near infrared extinction, and back trajectory calculations for a sample measurement location near the time of maximum emissions provide additional evidence that the elevated 2006 emissions resulted primarily from the Indonesia fires. Lower CO mixing ratios measured by ACE and fewer MODIS fire counts in Indonesia during October 2005 indicate lower emissions than during 2006. Coincident profiles from the ACE agree within the uncertainties with those from the tropospheric emission spectrometer (TES) for pressure ranges and time periods with good TES sensitivity after accounting for its lower vertical sensitivity compared with the ACE FTS.		1

Lowe	2008	5	Annales Geophysicae (ANGEO)		Copernicus GmbH (Copernicus Publications) on behalf of the European Geosciences Union (EGU)		26	4	795-811		Atmospheric composition, Airglow, aurora	http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/1009/		publications/pdfs/Mulligan-OHeqMaynooth.pdf				f	OH-equivalent temperatures were derived from all of the temperature profiles retrieved in 2004 and 2005 by the ACE-FTS instrument in a 5 degree band of latitude centred\r\n on a ground-based observing station at Maynooth. A\r\n globally averaged OH volume emission rate (VER) profile\r\n obtained from WINDII data was employed as a weighting\r\n function to compute the equivalent temperatures. The annual\r\n cycle of temperature thus produced was compared with the\r\n annual cycle of temperatures recorded at the ground-based\r\n station more than a decade earlier from the OH*(3-1) Meinel\r\n band. Both data sets showed excellent agreement in the absolute value of the temperature minimum (~162 K) and in\r\n its time of occurrence in the annual cycle at summer solstice.\r\n Away from mid-summer, however, the temperatures diverged\r\n and reach a maximum disagreement of more than 20K in\r\n mid-winter. Comparison of the Maynooth ground-based data\r\n with the corresponding results from two nearby stations in\r\n the same time-period indicated that the Maynooth data are\r\n consistent with other ground stations. The temperature difference between the satellite and ground-based datasets in winter was reduced to 14–15K by lowering the peak altitude of the weighting function to 84 km. An unrealistically low peak altitude would be required, however, to bring temperatures derived from the satellite into agreement with the ground-based data.\r\n OH equivalent temperatures derived from the SABER instrument\r\n using the same weighting function produced results that agreed well with ACE-FTS. When the OH 1.6μm VER profile measured by SABER was used as the weighting function, the OH equivalent temperatures increased in winter as expected but the summer temperatures were reduced resulting in an approximately constant offset of 8.6±0.8K between ground and satellite values with the ground values higher. Variability in both the altitude and width of the OH layer within a discernable seasonal variation were responsible\r\n for the changes introduced. The higher temperatures\r\n in winter were due to primarily to the lower altitude of the\r\n OH layer, while the colder summer temperatures were due\r\n to a thinner summer OH layer. We are not aware of previous\r\n reports of the effect of the layer width on ground-based\r\n temperatures.\r\n Comparison of OH-equivalent temperatures derived from\r\n ACE-FTS and SABER temperature profiles with OH*(3-1)\r\n temperatures from Wuppertal at 51.3 N which were measured\r\n during the same period showed a similar pattern to the Maynooth data from a decade earlier, but the warm offset\r\n of the ground values was lower at 4.5±0.5 K. This discrepancy between temperatures derived from ground-based\r\n instruments recording hydroxyl spectra and satellite borne\r\n instruments has been observed by other observers. Further\r\n work will be required by both the satellite and ground-based\r\n communities to identify the exact cause of this difference.		1

The precision, resolution, and accuracy of the data produced by the MLS version 2.2 processing algorithms are quantified, and recommendations for data screening are made. Temperature precision is 1 K or better from 316 hPa to 3.16 hPa, degrading to ∼3 K at 0.001 hPa. The vertical resolution is 3 km at 31.6 hPa, degrading to 6 km at 316 hPa and to ∼13 km at 0.001 hPa. Comparisons with analyses (Goddard Earth Observing System version 5.0.1 (GEOS-5), European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Met Office (MetO)) and other observations (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounder Unit (AIRS/AMSU), Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Radiometry (SABER), Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE), radiosondes) indicate that MLS temperature has persistent, pressure-dependent biases which are between −2.5 K and +1 K between 316 hPa and 10 hPa. The 100-hPa MLS v2.2 GPH surface has a bias of ∼150 m relative to the GEOS-5 values. These biases are compared to modeled systematic uncertainties. GPH biases relative to correlative measurements generally increase with height owing to an overall cold bias in MLS temperature relative to correlative temperature measurements in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere.		1

A total of 8703 profile measurements were taken in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere between February 2004 and August 2007. The zonal distribution of carbon tetrachloride displays a slight hemispheric asymmetry and decreasing concentration with increasing altitude at all latitudes. Maximum carbon tetrachloride concentrations are situated below 10 km in altitude with VMR (Volume Mixing Ratio) values of 100–130 ppt (parts per trillion). The highest concentrations are located about the Equator and at mid-latitudes, particularly for latitudes in heavily industrialised regions (20–45° N), with values declining towards the poles. Global distributions obtained from ACE were compared with predictions from three chemistry transport models showing good agreement in terms of the vertical gradient despite an overall offset. The ACE dataset gives unique global and temporal coverage of carbon tetrachloride and its transport through the atmosphere. An estimated lifetime for carbon tetrachloride of 34±5 years was determined through correlation with CFC-11.		1

Large upper tropospheric HCHO mixing ratios (>150 pptv) are observed during the growing season of the terrestrial biosphere in the Northern Hemisphere and during the biomass burning season in the Southern Hemisphere. The total errors estimated for the retrieved mixing ratios range from 30 to 40% in the upper troposphere and increase in the lower stratosphere. The sampled HCHO concentrations are in satisfactory agreement with previous aircraft and satellite observations with a negative bias (<25%) within observation errors. An overview of the seasonal cycle of the upper tropospheric HCHO is given for different latitudes, with a particular focus on mid-to-high latitudes that are well sampled by the observations. A maximum is observed during summer, i.e. during the growing season, in the northern mid- and high latitudes. The influence of biomass burning is visible in HCHO upper tropospheric concentrations during the September-to-October period in the southern tropics and subtropics. Comparisons with two state-of-the-art models (GEOS-Chem and LMDz-INCA) show that the models capture well the seasonal variations observed in the Northern Hemisphere (correlation >0.9). Both models underestimate the summer maximum over Europe and Russia and differences in the emissions used for North America result in a good reproduction of the summer maximum by GEOS-Chem but in an underestimate by LMDz-INCA. Globally, GEOS-Chem reproduces well the observations on average over one year but has some difficulties in reproducing the spatial variability of the observations. LMDz-INCA shows significant bias in the Southern Hemisphere, perhaps related to an underestimation of methane, but better reproduces the temporal and spatial variations. The differences between the models underline the large uncertainties that remain in the emissions of HCHO precursors.		1

Particular attention is given to accounting for the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) nature of the H2O 6.6 μm emission in the MLT. The non-LTE H2O(ν2) vibrational level populations responsible for this emission depend on energy exchange processes within the H2O vibrational system as well as on interactions with vibrationally excited states of the O2, N2, and CO2 molecules. The rate coefficients of these processes are known with large uncertainties that undermines the reliability of the H2O retrieval procedure. We developed a methodology of finding the optimal set of rate coefficients using the nearly coincidental solar occultation H2O density measurements by the ACE-FTS satellite and relying on the better signal-to-noise ratio of SABER daytime 6.6 μm measurements. From this comparison we derived an update to the rate coefficients of the three most important processes that affect the H2O(ν2) populations in the MLT: a) the vibrational-vibrational (V–V) exchange between the H2O and O2 molecules; b) the vibrational-translational (V–T) process of the O2(1) level quenching by collisions with atomic oxygen, and c) the V–T process of the H2O(010) level quenching by collisions with N2, O2, and O. Using the advantages of the daytime retrievals in the MLT, which are more stable and less susceptible to uncertainties of the radiance coming from below, we demonstrate that applying the updated H2O non-LTE model to the SABER daytime radiances makes the retrieved H2O vertical profiles in 50–85 km region consistent with climatological data and model predictions. The H2O retrieval uncertainties in this approach are about 10% at and below 70 km, 20% at 80 km, and 30% at 85 km altitude.		1

Solar spectra have been inverted with the PROFFIT 9.5 algorithm, using the optimal estimation method. An intercomparison of HF total columns retrieved with PROFFIT and SFIT-2–the other reference algorithm in the FTIR community–is performed for the first time. The effect of a Galatry line shape model on HF retrieved total columns and vertical profiles, on the residuals of the fits and on the error budget is also quantified. Information content analysis indicates that in addition to HF total vertical abundance, three independent stratospheric HF partial columns can be derived from our Bruker spectra. A complete error budget has been established and indicates that the main source of systematic error is linked to HF spectroscopy and that the random error affecting our HF total columns does not exceed 2.5%. Ground-based middle and upper stratospheric HF amounts have been compared to satellite data collected by the HALOE or ACE-FTS instruments. Comparisons of our FTIR HF total and partial columns with runs performed by two three-dimensional numerical models (SLIMCAT and KASIMA) are also included. Finally, FTIR and model HF total and partial columns time series have been analyzed to derive the main characteristics of their seasonal cycles.		1

Satellite-based remote sensing measurements of COClF, obtained by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) for a time period spanning February 2004 through April 2007, have been used in a global distribution study. There is a strong source region for COClF in the tropical stratosphere near 27 km. A layer of enhanced COClF spans the low- to mid-stratosphere over all latitudes, with volume mixing ratios of 40–100 parts per trillion by volume, largest in the tropics and decreasing toward the poles. The COClF volume mixing ratio profiles are nearly zonally symmetric, but they exhibit a small hemispheric asymmetry that likely arises from a hemispheric asymmetry in the parent molecule CCl3F. Comparisons are made with a set of in situ stratospheric measurements from the mid-1980s and with predictions from a 2-D model.		1

While solar spectra contain a lot of Ca I and Mg I infrared (IR) lines, no laboratory-measured spectra of these atoms have been reported for wavenumbers below 2000 cm-1. This study reports Ca I spectra in the 1300–4500 cm-1 range and Mg I spectra in the 1300–4500 cm-1 range.\r\nMethods. We performed a time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study of a plasma created by the laser ablation of MgF2 and CaF2 targets in a vacuum. The oscillator strengths (f-values) were calculated using quantum defect theory (QDT), which shows good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical results.\r\nResults. We report several Ca I and Mg I IR lines that have not been measured previously in laboratory. The recorded spectra allow the excitation energies of some Ca I and Mg I states with high orbital momentum (l = 4,5) to be determined. We also provide a long list of QDT-calculated f-values for Ca I and Mg I in the range of 800–9000 cm-1.		1

Averaged observed NO2 emission spectral shapes are obtained by spectrally resolving the NO + O continuum from the blended strong upper mesospheric OH vibration–rotation airglow bands. The observed continuum spectral shape when compared with laboratory measurements is shifted to lower wavelengths by approximately 20 nm in the steeply sloped 400 to 500 nm region. The observed laboratory continuum spectral shape for upper mesospheric ambient pressure is presented for reference over the 400 to 800 nm region. An example of an NO2 continuum volume emission-rate altitude profile derived from a single OSIRIS limb scan is also included. Limb radiances up to 3 × 109 photons cm–2 nm–1 s–1 are observed at the peak of the NO2 continuum corresponding to total volume emission rates of approximately 2 × 104 photons cm–3 s–1. Data extracted from numerous single-volume emission-rate altitude profiles obtained over approximately a 24 h period are assembled into a Southern Hemisphere polar map of the 90 km NO2 continuum emission. The map illustrates the considerable spatial brightness variation typically observed in the dark Antarctic polar region throughout the OSIRIS mission dataset. After further analysis these measurements will assist in quantifying the role of thermospheric formed NOx in the catalytic removal of ozone in the upper stratosphere.		1

Using a new set of spectroscopic line parameters recently published for formic acid by Vander Auwera et al.

We observe a significant seasonal dependence for the HCOOH concentrations related to vegetation growth and biomass burning. We estimate an emission ratio of 0.0051±0.0015 for HCOOH relative to CO for tropical South American fires using a selected set of data for September 2004. Results from the balloon-borne MkIV Fourier transform spectrometer are also presented and compared with the ACE measurements.		1

Consequently, we reconcile ground-based FTIR column measurements of HCN, which show annual and semi-annual variations, with recent space-borne measurements of HCN mixing ratio in the tropical lower stratosphere, which show a large two-year variation. We find that the observed column variability over the ground-based stations is determined by a superposition of HCN from several regional burning sources, with GEOS-Chem reproducing these column data with a positive bias of 5%. GEOS-Chem reproduces the observed HCN mixing ratio from the Microwave Limb Sounder and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment satellite instruments with a mean negative bias of 20%, and the observed HCN variability with a mean negative bias of 7%. We show that tropical biomass burning emissions explain most of the observed HCN variations in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), with the remainder due to atmospheric transport and HCN chemistry. In the mid and upper stratosphere, atmospheric dynamics progressively exerts more influence on HCN variations. The extent of temporal overlap between African and other continental burning seasons is key in establishing the apparent bienniel cycle in the UTLS. Similar analysis of other, shorter-lived trace gases have not observed the transition between annual and bienniel cycles in the UTLS probably because the signal of inter-annual variations from surface emission has been diluted before arriving at the lower stratosphere (LS), due to shorter atmospheric lifetimes.		1

However, two additional solar disk imagers (at 525 nm and 1020 nm) were added for a number of reasons, including the retrieval of aerosol and cloud products. In this paper, we present first comparison results for these imager aerosol/cloud optical extinction coefficient profiles, with the ones derived from measurements performed by 3 solar occultation instruments (SAGE II, SAGE III, POAM III), one stellar occultation instrument (GOMOS) and one limb sounder (OSIRIS). The results indicate that the ACE imager profiles are of good quality in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere, although the aerosol extinction for the visible channel at 525 nm contains a significant negative bias at higher altitudes, while the relative differences indicate that ACE profiles are almost always too high at 1020 nm. Both problems are probably related to ACE imager instrumental issues.		1

The independent instruments were: the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), the Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer-II (ILAS-II), the Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement (POAM III) instrument, the Middle Atmospheric Water Vapour Radiometer (MIAWARA), the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding, balloon-borne version (MIPAS-B), the Airborne Microwave Stratospheric Observing System (AMSOS), the Fluorescent Stratospheric Hygrometer for Balloon (FLASH-B), the NOAA frostpoint hygrometer, and the Fast In Situ Hygrometer (FISH). For the in-situ measurements and the ground based, air- and balloon borne remote sensing instruments, the measurements are restricted to central and northern Europe. The comparisons to satellite-borne instruments are predominantly at mid- to high latitudes on both hemispheres. In the stratosphere there is no clear indication of a bias in MIPAS data, because the independent measurements in some cases are drier and in some cases are moister than the MIPAS measurements. Compared to the infrared measurements of MIPAS, measurements in the ultraviolet and visible have a tendency to be high, whereas microwave measurements have a tendency to be low. The results of χ2-based precision validation are somewhat controversial among the comparison estimates. However, for comparison instruments whose error budget also includes errors due to uncertainties in spectrally interfering species and where good coincidences were found, the χ2 values found are in the expected range or even below. This suggests that there is no evidence of systematically underestimated MIPAS random errors.		1

The results are based solely on the ACE-FTS retrievals, without using any adjustable parameters. The computed particle formation time is in the range between 2 hours at 150 K and 20 hours at 120 K, during which particles come to equilibrium with water vapor and reach the size of 20–70 nm. The growth rate varies from 0.2 nm/hour to 30 nm/hour in the temperature range analyzed. As it takes ice crystals only 20 minutes to grow by 10 nm at 150 K, the transition from optically subvisible to the visible size range can occur on a time scale of minutes. This could account for fast variations in PMC brightness observed recently.		1

We present an overview of observations in the TTL and discuss the radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes that lead to its time-varying, three-dimensional structure. We present a synthesis definition with a bottom at 150 hPa, 355 K, 14 km (pressure, potential temperature, and altitude) and a top at 70 hPa, 425 K, 18.5 km. Laterally, the TTL is bounded by the position of the subtropical jets. We highlight recent progress in understanding of the TTL but emphasize that a number of processes, notably deep, possibly overshooting convection, remain not well understood. The TTL acts in many ways as a “gate” to the stratosphere, and understanding all relevant processes is of great importance for reliable predictions of future stratospheric ozone and climate.		1

We use Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) data, the SLIMCAT Chemistry Transport Model (CTM), and assimilated meteorological analyses to provide a comprehensive picture of transport during this event. The upper tropospheric ridge that triggered the SSW was associated with an elevated tropopause and layering in trace gas profiles in conjunction with stratospheric and tropospheric intrusions. Anomalous poleward transport (with corresponding quasi-isentropic troposphere-to-stratosphere exchange at the lowest levels studied) in the region over the ridge extended well into the lower stratosphere. In the middle and upper stratosphere, the breakdown of the polar vortex transport barrier was seen in a signature of rapid, widespread mixing in trace gases, including CO, H2O, CH4 and N2O. The vortex broke down slightly later and more slowly in the lower than in the middle stratosphere. In the middle and lower stratosphere, small remnants with trace gas values characteristic of the pre-SSW vortex lingered through the weak and slow recovery of the vortex. The upper stratospheric vortex quickly reformed, and, as enhanced diabatic descent set in, CO descended into this strong vortex, echoing the fall vortex development. Trace gas evolution in the SLIMCAT CTM agrees well with that in the satellite trace gas data from the upper troposphere through the middle stratosphere. In the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, the SLIMCAT simulation does not capture the strong descent of mesospheric CO and H2O values into the reformed vortex; this poor CTM performance in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere results primarily from biases in the diabatic descent in assimilated analyses.		1

However, measurements of total ozone in Antarctica do not show a compact and significant correlation with CR activity. Further, a substantial CR-induced heterogeneous loss of chlorofluorocarbons is incompatible with multiyear satellite observations of N2O and CFC-12. Thus, CR-induced heterogeneous reactions cannot be considered as an alternative mechanism causing the Antarctic ozone hole.		1

However, since the aircraft data are available only up to about 9–13 km altitude, these profiles do not fully represent the depth of the atmosphere observed by satellites and therefore need to be extended synthetically into the stratosphere. In the near future, observations of CO2 and CH4 made from passenger aircraft are expected to be available through the In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) project. In this study, we analyse three different data sources that are available for the stratospheric extension of aircraft profiles by comparing the error introduced by each of them into the total column and provide recommendations regarding the best approach. First, we analyse CH4 fields from two different models of atmospheric composition – the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System for Composition (C-IFS) and the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT 3-D chemical transport model. Secondly, we consider scenarios that simulate the effect of using CH4 climatologies such as those based on balloons or satellite limb soundings. Thirdly, we assess the impact of using a priori profiles used in the satellite retrievals for the stratospheric part of the total column. We find that the models considered in this study have a better estimation of the stratospheric CH4 as compared to the climatology-based data and the satellite a priori profiles. Both the C-IFS and TOMCAT models have a bias of about −9 ppb at the locations where tropospheric vertical profiles will be measured by IAGOS. The C-IFS model, however, has a lower random error (6.5 ppb) than TOMCAT (12.8 ppb). These values are well within the minimum desired accuracy and precision of satellite total column XCH4 retrievals (10 and 34 ppb, respectively). In comparison, the a priori profile from the University of Leicester Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) Proxy XCH4 retrieval and climatology-based data introduce larger random errors in the total column, being limited in spatial coverage and temporal variability. Furthermore, we find that the bias in the models varies with latitude and season. Therefore, applying appropriate bias correction to the model fields before using them for profile extension is expected to further decrease the error contributed by the stratospheric part of the profile to the total column.		1

The WVMS measurements are compared with Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) (1992–2005), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) (2004 to present), and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) Fourier transform spectrometer (2004 to present) measurements in the mesosphere. In the upper mesosphere Lyman α radiation photodissociates water vapor; hence, water vapor in the upper mesosphere varies with the solar cycle. We calculate fits to the WVMS and HALOE water vapor data in this region using the Lasp Interactive Solar Irradiance Datacenter Lyman α data set. This is, to our knowledge, the only published validation of the sensitivity of HALOE water vapor measurements to the solar cycle, and the HALOE and WVMS water vapor measurements show a very similar sensitivity to the solar cycle. Once the solar cycle variations are taken into account, the primary water vapor variations at all of these altitudes from 1992 to the present are an increase from 1992 to 1996, a maximum in water vapor in 1996, and small changes from 1997 to the present. Measurements from 2004 to 2008, which are available from WVMS, MLS, and ACE, show not only good agreement in interannual variations but also excellent agreement in their absolute measurements (to within better than 3%) of the water vapor mixing ratio from 50 to 80 km.		1

PSCs are of fundamental importance for the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole that occurs every year since the early 1980s in Southern Hemisphere spring. Despite progress in the observation, modeling and understanding of PSCs in recent years, there are still important questions which remain to be resolved, e.g. PSC microphysics, composition, formation mechanisms and long-term changes in occurrence. In addition, it has recently become clear that cirrus clouds significantly affect the global energy balance and climate, due to their influence on atmospheric thermal structure.\r\n\r\nSince 2002, two major space missions using the occultation method have been put into orbit: the European stellar occultation spectrometer GOMOS on board ENVISAT and the Canadian solar occultation instruments ACE-FTS/MAESTRO on board SCISAT-I.\r\n\r\nPSCs and cirrus clouds are detected both by ACE and GOMOS. The results of an intercomparison between retrieved aerosol extinction, PSCs and cirrus clouds are the subject of this paper. The cloud data are also used to examine the evolution of PSCs over the Antarctic vortex and the latitudinal variation of tropical cirrus for the years 2004 and 2005.		1

We re-analyzed the carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the atmospheres of the two bright K giants Arcturus (α Boo) and Aldebaran (α Tau).\r\nAims. These stars are in the evolutionary stage following the first dredge-up (FDU). Previous determinations (dating back more than 20 years) of their 16O/18O ratios showed a rough agreement with FDU expectations; however, the estimated 16O/17O and 12C/13C ratios were lower than in the canonical predictions for red giants. Today these anomalies are interpreted as signs of the occurrence of non-convective mixing episodes. We therefore re-investigated this problem to verify whether the observed data can be reproduced in this scenario and if the fairly well determined properties of the two stars can help us in fixing the uncertain parameters that characterize non-convective mixing and in constraining its physical nature.\r\nMethods. We used high-resolution infrared spectra from the literature to derive the 12C/13C and 16O/17O/18O ratios from CO molecular lines near 5 μm, using the local termodynamic equilibrium (LTE) spectral synthesis method. We made use of the recently published ACE-FTS atlas of the infrared solar spectrum for constructing an updated atomic and molecular line lists in this spectral range. We also reconsidered the determination of the stellar parameters to build the proper atmospheric and evolutionary models.\r\nResults. We found that both the C and the O isotopic ratios for the two stars considered actually disagree with pure FDU predictions. This reinforces the idea that non-convective transport episodes occurred in these stars. By reproducing the observed elemental and isotopic abundances with the help of parametric models for the coupled occurrence of nucleosynthesis and mass circulation, we derived constraints on the properties of non-convective mixing, providing information on the so far elusive physics of these phenomena. We find that very slow mixing, like that associated to diffusive processes, is incapable of explaining the observed data, which require a fast transport. Circulation mechanisms with speeds intermediate between those typical of diffusive and convective mixing are necessary. We conclude with a word of caution on the conclusions possible at this stage however, as the parameters for the mass transport are fairly sensitive to the stellar mass and initial composition. At least for α Boo, reducing the uncertainty still remaining on these data would be highly desirable.		1
203	KRASNOPOLSKY2014189	Observations of the CO dayglow at 4.7μm on Mars: Variations of temperature and CO mixing ratio at 50km	V. A. Krasnopolsky	2014	1	Icarus				228	\N	189-196		Spectroscopy	http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103513004272		publications/pdfs/Krasnopolsky-Icarus-COdayglow.pdf			http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.10.008	f	The CO (2-1) and (1-0) dayglow at 4.7 μm was observed on Mars at the peak of northern summer (LS = 110°) using the CSHELL spectrograph at NASA IRTF. There are six (2-1) and two (1-0) emission lines in the observed spectra. They are contaminated by the solar CO lines and some martian and telluric lines. Fitting by synthetic spectra results in intensities of the dayglow lines and reflectivities of Mars at 4.7 μm. Mean reflectivity at 109°W from 50°S to 50°N is 0.15, similar to that observed by Mariner 6 and 7 in four regions on Mars. The CO (1-0) dayglow is excited by absorption of sunlight at 4.7 μm; the emission is optically thick with a non-LTE line distribution and peaks near 87 km. The (1-0) line intensities are converted to the (1-0) band intensity using the line distribution from Billebaud et al. (1991). Mean intensity of the CO (1-0) dayglow is 1.7 MR with a weak limb darkening to 1.3 MR. This dayglow is poorly accessible for diagnostics of the martian atmosphere. The CO (2-1) dayglow is excited by absorption of the sunlight by the CO (2-0) band at 2.35 μm with minor contributions from photolysis of CO2 and the CO (3-0) band at 1.58 μm. The dayglow is quenched by CO2 and peaks at 50 km. Intensities of the observed six (2-1) lines result in rotational temperatures that should be equal to ambient temperatures at 50 km. These temperatures are retrieved from 50°S to 90°N and vary in the range of 140–170 K with a mean value of 153 K. The observed intensities of the CO (2-1) dayglow are corrected for airmass and the surface reflection and give vertical intensities that are equal to 2.1 MR at 20°N to 50°N decreasing to 1.5 MR at 90°N and 1 MR at 45°S. The dayglow intensities depend on CO mixing ratio at 50 km and solar zenith angle. Retrieved CO mixing ratios at 50 km gradually increase from 1100 ppm at 40°S to 1600 ppm at 70°N. This behavior is very different from that observed in the lowest scale height at the same season with increase to southern polar regions because of condensation of CO2 near the south pole (Krasnopolsky, V.A. [2003]. Icarus 165, 315–325). The difference reflects complicated dynamic processes in the atmosphere. This is the first observation of CO in the middle atmosphere of Mars, and the observed behavior of CO should be further studied in both observation and theory. The CO (2-1) dayglow is a tool for remote sensing of temperature and CO at 50 km on Mars using ground-based and spacecraft instruments. The observed CO and temperatures may be used to test photochemical GCMs for Mars.		1

The results are obtained by combining the extinction measurements made by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) Fourier-Transform Spectrometer and the visible/near IR imagers on the SCISAT satellite. The extended wavenumber range provided by this combination (750 to 20 000 cm−1) enables the retrieval of aerosol particle sizes between 0.05 and 10 μm as well as providing extensive information about the compositions. Our results indicate that liquid ternary solutions with a high (>30 wt%) content of HNO3 were the most probable component of the clouds at the (60–70° N) latitudes accessible by ACE. The mean size of these ternary aerosol particles is in the range of 0.3 to 0.8 μm. Less abundant, although still frequent, were clouds composed of NAT particles having radii in the range of 1 μm and clouds of ice particles having mean radii in the 4–5 μm range. In some cases, these last two types were found in the same observation.		1

Usually, cloud signatures are detected on aerosol extinction profiles. In this paper, ACE two-dimensional (2-D) imager data are used to show PSCs and cirrus clouds. Clouds can be clearly seen, with a good vertical and horizontal resolution (1 km), during sunset and sunrise. In addition, we discovered significant differences between stratospheric (PSCs) and tropospheric (cirrus) clouds. PSCs appear as “symmetric” layers, no horizontal or vertical “structure” is detected within the PSC, suggesting that PSCs are uniform clouds with a very large horizontal extent. On the other hand, cirrus cloud image geometry is not well-defined. In contrast to PSCs, cirrus clouds appear as irregular shaped clouds. These tropospheric clouds seem to have horizontal dimensions similar to the Sun on the image (25 km at the tangent point). The qualitative display of these different kinds of clouds, seen on the raw 2-D imager data, proves the ability of the imagers to be an efficient cloud detector in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) region. Moreover, the structure of these clouds can be derived.		1

The ACE mission payload consists of two science instruments: a high-resolution infrared Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (FTS) and an ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared spectrometer. These instruments primarily function in occultation mode. However, during the dark portion of the orbit, the Earth passes between the Sun and the satellite. In this configuration, the ACE-FTS has the opportunity to acquire some nadir-view spectra of the Earth. Since the ACE-FTS was designed to view a hot source (i.e., the Sun) at high resolution using a single scan, it was necessary to determine if the ACE-FTS could also provide nadir spectra of the relatively cold atmosphere and surface with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As part of the pre-launch test program, laboratory measurements were performed to investigate this possibility. This paper reports the laboratory spectra of methane, ozone, and carbon monoxide gases measured with the ACE-FTS to determine the performance characteristics of the instrument when viewing a low-intensity blackbody source. From these results, it was shown that the ACE-FTS may be capable of measuring the column amounts of several abundant trace gases, such as methane, ozone, and nitrous oxide, in the atmosphere with sufficient SNR.		1

Volume mixing ratio (VMR) FTS measurements from the ATMOS (atmospheric trace molecule spectroscopy) FTS covering 120–10 hPa (∼16–30 km altitude) at 25°N–35°N latitude from 1985 and 1994 have been combined with Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) SCISAT-1 FTS measurements covering the same latitude and pressure range from 2004 to 2008. The CH4 trend was estimated by referencing the VMRs to those measured for the long-lived constituent N2O to account for the dynamic history of the sampled airmasses. The combined measurement set shows that the VMR increase measured by ATMOS has been replaced by a leveling off during the ACE measurement time period. Our conclusion is consistent with both remote sensing and in situ measurements of the CH4 trend obtained over the same time span.		1

The nucleation of condensed phase is traced back to the first step on the formation pathway, which is assumed to be the transition of water vapor to amorphous cluster. Amorphous clusters then freeze into water ice, likely metastable cubic ice, when they reach the critical size. The estimates based on the equilibrium thermodynamics give the critical size (radius) of amorphous water clusters as about 1.0 nm. The same estimates for the final transition step, that is the transformation of cubic to hexagonal ice, give the critical size of about 15 nm at typical upper mesospheric conditions during the polar summer (temperature T=150 K, water vapor density ρvapor=109 cm−3).		1

The HDO/H2O ratio was retrieved from ground-based observations using high-dispersion echelle spectroscopy of the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) of the Subaru telescope. Coordinated joint observations were made by the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) onboard Mars Express (MEX). The observations were performed during the middle of northern spring (Ls = 52°) and at the beginning of summer (Ls = 96°) in Mars Year 31. The retrieved latitudinal mean HDO/H2O ratios are 4.1 ± 1.4 (Ls = 52°) and 4.4 ± 1.0 (Ls = 96°) times larger than the terrestrial Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). The HDO/H2O ratio shows a large seasonal variation at high latitudes. The HDO/H2O ratio significantly increases from 2.4 ± 0.6 wrt VSMOW at Ls = 52° to 5.5 ± 1.1 wrt VSMOW at Ls = 96° over the latitude range between 70°N and 80°N. This can be explained by preferential condensation of HDO vapor during the northern fall, winter, and spring and sublimation of the seasonal polar cap in the northern summer. In addition, we investigated the geographical distribution of the HDO/H2O ratio over low latitudes at the northern spring in the longitudinal range between 220°W and 360°W, including different local times from 10 h to 17 h. We found the HDO/H2O ratio has no significant variation (5.1 ± 1.2 wrt VSMOW) over the entire range. Our observations suggest that the HDO/H2O distribution in the northern spring and summer seasons is mainly controlled by condensation-induced fractionation between the seasonal northern polar cap and the atmosphere.		1

The satellite was launched in August 2003 and since February 2004 the ACE-FTS has been performing solar occultation measurements in order to infer the chemical composition of the terrestrial atmosphere. The individual spectra recorded at the highest limb tangent altitudes (above 160 km) are by definition “high sun” spectra and contain no atmospheric contribution. In this work, an empirical solar spectrum covering the 700 to 4430 cm−1 spectral range has been constructed from an average of 224,782 individual ACE-FTS solar spectra. Line assignments have been made for about 12,000 lines. The spectrum and two line lists are provided in the supplemental material attached to this work. Due to the excellent noise level achieved in the ACE-FTS solar atlas presented here, numerous weak absorption features are assigned which were not detectable in the ATMOS solar observations.		1

The observations were made in three sessions (October 2007, January 2009, and June 2009) at early morning and late afternoon on Venus in the latitude range of ±60°. CO2 lines at 2.25 μm reveal variations of the cloud aerosol density (∼25%) and scale height near 65 km. The measured reflectivity of Venus at low latitudes is 0.7 at 2.25 μm and 0.028 at 3.66 μm, and the effective CO2 column density is smaller at 3.66 μm than those at 2.25 μm by a factor of 4. This agrees with the almost conservative multiple scattering at 2.25 μm and single scattering in the almost black aerosol at 3.66 μm. The expected difference is just a factor of (1 − g)−1 = 4, where g = 0.75 is the scattering asymmetry factor for Venus’ clouds. The observed CO mixing ratio is 52 ± 4 ppm near 08:00 and 40 ± 4 ppm near 16:30 at 68 km, and the higher ratio in the morning may be caused by extension of the CO morningside bulge to the cloud tops. The observed weak limb brightening in CO indicates an increase of the CO mixing ratio with altitude. HF is constant at 3.5 ± 0.2 ppb at 68 km in both morningside and afternoon observations and in the latitude range ±60°. Therefore the observations do not favor a bulge of HF, though HF is lighter than CO. Probably a source in the upper atmosphere facilitates the bulge formation. The recent measurements of HCl near 70 km are controversial (0.1 and 0.74 ppm) and require either a strong sink or a strong source of HCl in the clouds. The HCl lines of the (2-0) band are blended by the solar and telluric lines. Therefore we observed the P8 lines of the (1-0) band at 3.44 μm. These lines are spectrally clean and result in the HCl mixing ratio of 0.40 ± 0.03 ppm at 74 km. HCl does not vary with latitude within ±60°. Our observations support a uniformly mixed HCl throughout the Venus atmosphere.		1

By combining the new observations with the previously published data and recent far infrared data, an improved set of molecular constants and term values have been derived for the X3Σ− and A3Π states.		1

While the presented technique is applicable for a wide variety of optical and infrared spectra, we concentrate in this paper on selected high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph to demonstrate its performance and limitation. We find that synthetic spectra reproduce telluric absorption features to about 2%, even close to saturated line cores. Thus, synthetic telluric spectra could be used to replace the observation of telluric standard stars, saving valuable observing time. This technique also provides a precise in-situ wavelength calibration, especially useful for high-resolution near-infrared spectra in the absence of other calibration sources.		1

The Camtracker consists of a homemade altazimuthal solar tracker, a digital camera and a homemade program to process the camera data and to control the motion of the tracker. The key idea is to evaluate the image of the radiation source on the entrance field stop of the spectrometer. We prove that the system reaches tracking accuracies of about 10 arc s for a ground-based solar absorption FTIR spectrometer, which is significantly better than current solar trackers. Moreover, due to the incorporation of a camera, the new system allows to document residual pointing errors and to point onto the solar disk center even in case of variable intensity distributions across the source due to cirrus or haze.		1

The University of Leicester IASI Retrieval Scheme (ULIRS) is an optimal estimation retrieval scheme, which utilises equidistant pressure levels and a floating pressure grid based on topography. It makes use of explicit digital elevation and emissivity information, and incorporates a correction for solar surface reflection in the daytime with a high resolution solar spectrum. The retrieval scheme has been assessed through a formal error analysis, via the simulation of surface effects and by an application to real IASI data over a region in Southern Africa. The ULIRS enables the retrieval of between 1 and 2 pieces of information about the tropospheric CO vertical profiles, with peaks in the sensitivity at approximately 5 and 12 km. Typical errors for the African region relating to the profiles are found to be ~20% at 5 and 12 km, and on the total columns to range from 18 to 34%. Finally the performance of the ULIRS is shown for a range of simulated geophysical conditions.		1

Mumma	2011	1	The Astrophysical Journal				727	2	91-102			http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/727/i=2/a=91		publications/pdfs/Kawakita-CometAmmonia.pdf				f	Ammonia is a major reservoir of nitrogen atoms in cometary materials. However, detections of ammonia in comets are rare, with several achieved at radio wavelengths. A few more detections were obtained through near-infrared observations (around the 3 μm wavelength region), but moderate relative velocity shifts are required to separate emission lines of cometary ammonia from telluric absorption lines in the 3 μm wavelength region. On the other hand, the amidogen radical (NH 2 —a photodissociation product of ammonia in the coma) also shows rovibrational emission lines in the 3 μm wavelength region. Thus, gas production rates for ammonia can be determined from the rovibrational emission lines of ammonia (directly) and amidogen radical (indirectly) simultaneously in the near-infrared. In this article, we present new fluorescence excitation models for cometary ammonia and amidogen radical in the near-infrared, and we apply these models to the near-infrared high-dispersion spectra of comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) to determine the mixing ratio of ammonia to water in the comet. Based on direct detection of NH 3 lines, the mixing ratio of NH 3 /H 2 O is 0.46% ± 0.03% in C/2004 Q2 (Machholz), in agreement with other results. The mixing ratio of ammonia determined from the NH 2 observations (0.31%-0.79%) is consistent but has relatively larger error, owing to uncertainty in the photodissociation rates of ammonia. At the present level of accuracy, we confirm that NH 3 could be the sole parent of NH 2 in this comet.		1

Observations in December 2009 at LS = 20° and 0–30°W included spectra of the Moon at a similar airmass as a telluric calibrator. A technique for extraction of the martian methane line from a combination of the Mars and Moon spectra has been developed. The observations reveal no methane with an upper limit of 8 ppb. The results of both sessions agree with the observations by Mumma et al. (Mumma, M.J. et al. [2009]. Science 323, 1041–1045) at the same season in February 2006 and are smaller than those in the PFS and TES maps. Production and removal of the biological methane on Mars do not significantly change the redox state of the atmosphere and the balance of hydrogen. A search for ethane at 2977 cm−1 results in an upper limit of 0.2 ppb. However, this limit does not help to establish the origin of methane on Mars. Reanalysis of our search for SO2 using TEXES confirms the recently established upper limit of 0.3 ppb. Along with the lack of hot spots and gas vents with endogenic heat sources in the THEMIS observations, the very low upper limit to SO2 on Mars does not favor geological methane that is less abundant than SO2 in the outgassing from the terrestrial planets.		1

This method is intentionally kept simple and based on a combination of an onion peeling approach with a modified DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) fit in the wavelength region around 940 nm. Reasonable resulting water vapour profiles are currently obtained in the altitude range 15–45 km. Comparisons of the SCIAMACHY profiles with water vapour data provided by the Atmospheric Chemistry Explorer Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) show an average agreement within about 5% between 20 and 45 km. SCIAMACHY water vapour data tend to be systematically higher than ACE-FTS. These results are in principal confirmed by comparisons with water vapour profiles derived from model data of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), although ECMWF concentrations are systematicly lower than both corresponding SCIAMACHY and ACE-FTS data at all altitudes.		1

On the basis of a greatly expanded set of spectroscopic parameters, we built a full non-resonance cascade fluorescence model and computed fluorescence efficiencies for H2O (500 million lines) and HDO (700 million lines). The new line list was also integrated into an advanced terrestrial radiative transfer code (LBLRTM) and adapted to the CO2 rich atmosphere of Mars, for which we adopted the complex Robert–Bonamy formalism for line shapes. We retrieved water and D/H in the atmospheres of Mars, comet C/2007 W1 (Boattini), and Earth by applying the new formalism to spectra obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph NIRSPEC/Keck II atop Mauna Kea (Hawaii). The new model accurately describes the complex morphology of the water bands and greatly increases the accuracy of the retrieved abundances (and the D/H ratio in water) with respect to previously available models. The new model provides improved agreement of predicted and measured intensities for many H2O lines already identified in comets, and it identifies several unassigned cometary emission lines as new emission lines of H2O. The improved spectral accuracy permits retrieval of more accurate rotational temperatures and production rates for cometary water.		1

The need for atomic line data from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR) regions is greater now than ever. In the past twenty years, the time since the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, great progress has been made in acquiring atomic data for UV transitions. The optical wavelength region, now expanded by progress in detector technology, continues to provide motivation for new atomic data. In addition, investments in new instrumentation for ground-based and space observatories has lead to the availability of high-quality spectra at IR wavelengths, where the need for atomic data is most critical. In this review, examples are provided of the progress made in generating atomic data for stellar studies, with a look to the future for addressing the accuracy and completeness of atomic data for anticipated needs.		1

Very few observationally based high-resolution ESS are available in this spectral region. Consequently, the theoretically calculated ESS by Kurucz has been widely adopted. We present the CAVIAR (Continuum Absorption at Visible and Infrared Wavelengths and its Atmospheric Relevance) ESS, which is derived using the Langley technique applied to calibrated observations using a ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) in atmospheric windows from 2000 to 10,000 cm–1 (1–5 µm). There is good agreement between the strengths and positions of solar lines between the CAVIAR and the satellite-based Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-FTS ESS, in the spectral region where they overlap, and good agreement with other ground-based FTS measurements in two near-IR windows. However, there are significant differences in the structure between the CAVIAR ESS and spectra from semiempirical models. In addition, we found a difference of up to 8% in the absolute (and hence the wavelength-integrated) irradiance between the CAVIAR ESS and that of Thuillier et al., which was based on measurements from the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science satellite and other sources. In many spectral regions, this difference is significant, because the coverage factor k = 2 (or 95% confidence limit) uncertainties in the two sets of observations do not overlap. Because the total solar irradiance is relatively well constrained, if the CAVIAR ESS is correct, then this would indicate an integrated “loss” of solar irradiance of about 30 W m–2 in the near-IR that would have to be compensated by an increase at other wavelengths.		1

In the lower troposphere, PAN has a relatively short lifetime and is principally destroyed within a few hours through thermolysis, but it can act as a reservoir and carrier of NOx in the colder temperatures of the upper troposphere, where UV photolysis becomes the dominant loss mechanism. Pyroconvective updrafts from large biomass burning events can inject PAN into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), providing a means for the long-range transport of NOx. Given the extended lifetimes at these higher altitudes, PAN is readily detectable via satellite remote sensing. \r\n\r\nA new PAN data product is now available for the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) version 3.0 data set. We report observations of PAN in boreal biomass burning plumes recorded during the BORTAS (quantifying the impact of BOReal forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants over the Atlantic using Aircraft and Satellites) campaign (12 July to 3 August 2011). The retrieval method employed by incorporating laboratory-recorded absorption cross sections into version 3.0 of the ACE-FTS forward model and retrieval software is described in full detail. The estimated detection limit for ACE-FTS PAN is 5 pptv, and the total systematic error contribution to the ACE-FTS PAN retrieval is ~ 16%. \r\n\r\nThe retrieved volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles are compared to coincident measurements made by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instrument on the European Space Agency (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT). The MIPAS measurements demonstrated good agreement with the ACE-FTS VMR profiles for PAN, where the measured VMR values are well within the associated measurement errors for both instruments and comparative measurements differ no more than 70 pptv. \r\n\r\nThe ACE-FTS PAN data set is used to obtain zonal mean distributions of seasonal averages from ~ 5–20 km. A strong seasonality is clearly observed for PAN concentrations in the global UTLS. Since the principal source of PAN in the UTLS is due to lofted biomass burning emissions from the pyroconvective updrafts created by large fires, the observed seasonality in enhanced PAN coincides with fire activity in different geographical regions throughout the year.		1

With CRIRES, we detected five CO emission lines on several nights in each epoch, confirming the ubiquitous content and release of carbon monoxide from the nucleus. This is the first simultaneous detection of multiple lines from any (neutral) gaseous species in comet 29P at infrared wavelengths. It is also the first extraction of a rotational temperature based on the intensities of simultaneously measured spectral lines in 29P, and the retrieved rotational temperature is the lowest obtained in our infrared survey to date. We present the retrieved production rates (~3 × 10 28 molecules s –1 ) and remarkably low (~5 K) rotational temperatures for CO, and compare them with results from previous observations at radio wavelengths. Along with CO, we pursued detections of other volatiles, namely H 2 O, C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 2 , CH 4 , HCN, NH 3 , and CH 3 OH. Although they were not detected, we present sensitive upper limits. These results establish a new record for detections by infrared spectroscopy of parent volatiles in comets at large heliocentric distances. Until now considered to be a somewhat impossible task with IR ground-based facilities, these discoveries demonstrate new opportunities for targeting volatile species in distant comets.		1

While during most flights significant amounts of ClO (≈10–20 parts per trillion, ppt) were present only in aged stratospheric air, instances of enhanced ClO mixing ratios of up to 40 ppt – significantly exceeding those expected from gas phase chemistry – were observed in air masses of a more tropospheric character. Most of these observations are associated with low temperatures or with the presence of cirrus clouds (often both), suggesting that cirrus ice particles and/or liquid aerosol at low temperatures may promote significant heterogeneous chlorine activation in the tropical upper troposphere lower stratosphere (UTLS). In two case studies, particularly high levels of ClO observed were reproduced by chemistry simulations only under the assumption that significant denoxification had occurred in the observed air. However, to reproduce the ClO observations in these simulations, O3 mixing ratios higher than observed had to be assumed, and at least for one of these flights, a significant denoxification is in contrast to the observed NO levels, suggesting that the coupling of chlorine and nitrogen compounds in the tropical UTLS may not be completely understood.		1

This fraction is comparable to the ratio for stratospheric ozone and is thus supposed to have originated from the terrestrial upper atmosphere through transport of oxygen ions by the intense Earth wind. In this paper, we develop a one-dimensional chemical model that can solve for the ionic and neutral compositions of oxygen isotopes by including the isotopic effects in dynamical, photolytic, and chemical processes. We first confirm that the isotopic ratios of O+, O2+, O, and O2 are nearly mass dependent, Δ17O≈0 per mil, when the isotopic effects of multiple (eddy, molecular, and ambipolar) diffusion processes are taken into account. We examine which photolytic and chemical processes can produce a strong MIF for oxygen species and select four candidates: photo-dissociative ionization of O2, photo-dissociation of O2 by Lyman-α solar emissions, charge exchange between O+ and O2+, and atomic exchanges between O and O2. We estimated the oxygen isotopic ratio to be Δ17O≈1–4 per mil at the height of 100–400 km on the basis of a statistical treatment of atom mechanics. These values are smaller than those in the lunar case, and we conclude that a more rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of photo-dissociation processes will be necessary before we can make an evaluation of the role of Earth-escaping oxygen isotopes.		1

It consists of a suite of three high-resolution spectrometers – \\SO\\ (Solar Occultation), \\LNO\\ (Limb, Nadir and Occultation) and \\UVIS\\ (Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer). Based upon the characteristics of the channels and the values of Signal-to-Noise Ratio obtained from radiometric models discussed in (Vandaele et al., 2015a, 2015b; Thomas et al., 2016), the expected performances of the instrument in terms of sensitivity to detection have been investigated. The analysis led to the determination of detection limits for 18 molecules, namely CO, H2O, HDO, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, H2CO, CH4, SO2, H2S, HCl, HCN, HO2, NH3, N2O, NO2, OCS, O3. \\NOMAD\\ should have the ability to measure methane concentrations &lt;25 parts per trillion (ppt) in solar occultation mode, and 11 parts per billion in nadir mode. Occultation detections as low as 10 ppt could be made if spectra are averaged (Drummond et al., 2011). Results have been obtained for all three channels in nadir and in solar occultation.		1

This paper presents intercomparisons between ozone and NO2 measured by the ACE and OSIRIS satellite instruments and by ground-based instruments at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL), which is located at Eureka, Canada (80° N, 86° W) and is operated by the Canadian Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC). The ground-based instruments included in this study are four zenith-sky differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) instruments, one Bruker Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and four Brewer spectrophotometers. Ozone total columns measured by the DOAS instruments were retrieved using new Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) guidelines and agree to within 3.2%. The DOAS ozone columns agree with the Brewer spectrophotometers with mean relative differences that are smaller than 1.5%. This suggests that for these instruments the new NDACC data guidelines were successful in producing a homogenous and accurate ozone dataset at 80° N. Satellite 14–52 km ozone and 17–40 km NO2 partial columns within 500 km of PEARL were calculated for ACE-FTS Version 2.2 (v2.2) plus updates, ACE-FTS v3.0, ACE-MAESTRO (Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation) v1.2 and OSIRIS SaskMART v5.0x ozone and Optimal Estimation v3.0 NO2 data products. The new ACE-FTS v3.0 and the validated ACE-FTS v2.2 partial columns are nearly identical, with mean relative differences of 0.0 ± 0.2% and −0.2 ± 0.1% for v2.2 minus v3.0 ozone and NO2, respectively. Ozone columns were constructed from 14–52 km satellite and 0–14 km ozonesonde partial columns and compared with the ground-based total column measurements. The satellite-plus-sonde measurements agree with the ground-based ozone total columns with mean relative differences of 0.1–7.3%. For NO2, partial columns from 17 km upward were scaled to noon using a photochemical model. Mean relative differences between OSIRIS, ACE-FTS and ground-based NO2 measurements do not exceed 20%. ACE-MAESTRO measures more NO2 than the other instruments, with mean relative differences of 25–52%. Seasonal variation in the differences between NO2 partial columns is observed, suggesting that there are systematic errors in the measurements and/or the photochemical model corrections. For ozone spring-time measurements, additional coincidence criteria based on stratospheric temperature and the location of the polar vortex were found to improve agreement between some of the instruments. For ACE-FTS v2.2 minus Bruker FTIR, the 2007–2009 spring-time mean relative difference improved from −5.0 ± 0.4% to −3.1 ± 0.8% with the dynamical selection criteria. This was the largest improvement, likely because both instruments measure direct sunlight and therefore have well-characterized lines-of-sight compared with scattered sunlight measurements. For NO2, the addition of a ±1° latitude coincidence criterion improved spring-time intercomparison results, likely due to the sharp latitudinal gradient of NO2 during polar sunrise. The differences between satellite and ground-based measurements do not show any obvious trends over the missions, indicating that both the ACE and OSIRIS instruments continue to perform well.		1

Recently reprocessed LIMS data are compared to more recent measurements from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) to place the LIMS measurements in the context of current observations. The amount of NOx (NO + NO2) entering the stratosphere that has been created by EPP in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (EPP-NOx) has been quantified for the 1978–1979 and 2002–2003 through 2008–2009 Arctic winters. The NO2 enhancements in the LIMS data are similar to those in MIPAS and ACE-FTS data in the Arctic winters of 2002–2003, 2004–2005, 2006–2007, and 2007–2008. The largest enhancement by far is in 2003–2004 (∼2.2 Gmol at 1500 K), which is attributed to a combination of elevated EPP and unusual dynamics that led to strong descent in the upper stratosphere/lower mesosphere in late winter. The enhancements in 2005–2006 and 2008–2009, during which large stratospheric NOx enhancements were caused by a dynamical situation similar to that in 2003–2004, are larger than in all the other years (except 2003–2004) at 3000 K. However, by 2000 K the enhancements in 2005–2006 (2008–2009) are on the same order of magnitude as (smaller than) all other years. These results highlight the importance of the timing of the descent in determining the potential of EPP-NOx for reaching the middle stratosphere.		1

We compare measurements of SWV (and methane where available) over the period 1980–2011 from NOAA balloon-borne frostpoint hygrometer (NOAA-FPH), SAGE II, Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)/Aura, and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) to model predictions based on troposphere-to-stratosphere transport from ERA-Interim, and temperatures from ERA-Interim, Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis (MERRA), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), Radiosonde Atmospheric Temperature Products for Assessing Climate (RATPAC), HadAT2, and RICHv1.5. All model predictions are dry biased. The interannual anomalies of the model predictions show periods of fairly regular oscillations, alternating with more quiescent periods and a few large-amplitude oscillations. They all agree well (correlation coefficients 0.9 and larger) with observations for higher-frequency variations (periods up to 2–3 years). Differences between SWV observations, and temperature data, respectively, render analysis of the model minus observation residual difficult. However, we find fairly well-defined periods of drifts in the residuals. For the 1980s, model predictions differ most, and only the calculation with ERA-Interim temperatures is roughly within observational uncertainties. All model predictions show a drying relative to HALOE in the 1990s, followed by a moistening in the early 2000s. Drifts to NOAA-FPH are similar (but stronger), whereas no drift is present against SAGE II. As a result, the model calculations have a less pronounced drop in SWV in 2000 than HALOE. From the mid-2000s onward, models and observations agree reasonably, and some differences can be traced to problems in the temperature data. These results indicate that both SWV and temperature data may still suffer from artifacts that need to be resolved in order to answer the question whether the large-scale flow and temperature field is sufficient to explain water entering the stratosphere.		1

This reanalysis provides fields of chemically reactive gases, namely carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and formaldehyde, as well as aerosols and greenhouse gases globally at a horizontal resolution of about 80 km for both the troposphere and the stratosphere. This paper describes the assimilation system for the reactive gases and presents validation results for the reactive gas analysis fields to document the data set and to give a first indication of its quality. \r\n\r\nTropospheric CO values from the MACC reanalysis are on average 10–20% lower than routine observations from commercial aircrafts over airports through most of the troposphere, and have larger negative biases in the boundary layer at urban sites affected by air pollution, possibly due to an underestimation of CO or precursor emissions. \r\n\r\nStratospheric ozone fields from the MACC reanalysis agree with ozonesondes and ACE-FTS data to within ±10% in most seasons and regions. In the troposphere the reanalysis shows biases of −5% to +10% with respect to ozonesondes and aircraft data in the extratropics, but has larger negative biases in the tropics. Area-averaged total column ozone agrees with ozone fields from a multi-sensor reanalysis data set to within a few percent. \r\n\r\nNO2 fields from the reanalysis show the right seasonality over polluted urban areas of the NH and over tropical biomass burning areas, but underestimate wintertime NO2 maxima over anthropogenic pollution regions and overestimate NO2 in northern and southern Africa during the tropical biomass burning seasons. \r\n\r\nTropospheric HCHO is well simulated in the MACC reanalysis even though no satellite data are assimilated. It shows good agreement with independent SCIAMACHY retrievals over regions dominated by biogenic emissions with some anthropogenic input, such as the eastern US and China, and also over African regions influenced by biogenic sources and biomass burning.		1

Here, we investigate air mass transport from the monsoon anticyclone into the stratosphere using a Lagrangian chemistry transport model. We show how two main transport pathways from the anticyclone emerge: (i) into the tropical stratosphere (tropical pipe), and (ii) into the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical lower stratosphere. Maximum anticyclone air mass fractions reach around 5 % in the tropical pipe and 15 % in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere over the course of a year. The anticyclone air mass fraction correlates well with satellite hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and carbon monoxide (CO) observations, confirming that pollution is transported deep into the tropical stratosphere from the Asian monsoon anticyclone. Cross-tropopause transport occurs in a vertical chimney, but with the pollutants transported quasi-horizontally along isentropes above the tropopause into the tropics and NH.		1

Using the early winter correlations of reactive trace gases with N2O from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), we find high depletion of chlorine reservoir gases up to ∼40% (0.8 ppbv) at 12 km to 14 km altitude in the vortex and 0.4 ppbv at the edge in subsided stratospheric air with mean ages up to 4.5 years. We observe denitrification of up to 4 ppbv, while ozone was depleted by 1.2 ppmv at potential temperatures as low as 380 K. The advanced instrumentation aboard HALO enables high-resolution measurements with implications for the oxidation capacity of the lowermost stratosphere.		1

Recent analyses of these measurements had indicated that CO2 above approximately 90 km appeared to be increasing about twice as fast as it was in the lower atmosphere. Models could not reproduce this differential CO2 trend, calculating instead that the proportional CO2 increase is approximately constant with altitude. We found three issues with the methodologies used to derive trends from CO2 profiles: the way that seasonal changes and sampling are accounted for in the analysis, referred to as deseasonalizing; the registration of profiles in pressure versus altitude coordinates; and data quality indicators. Each of these can have significant effects on the derivation of trends. We applied several deseasonalizing procedures, using both pressure and altitude coordinates, also used a time series fit without deseasonalizing, and applied data quality filters. The derived trends were approximately constant with pressure or altitude, about 5.5% per decade, consistent with lower atmosphere CO2 trends, and consistent with model calculations. We conclude that the difference between the trend of CO2 above the CO2 homopause and the trend in the lower, well-mixed atmosphere is not statistically significant.		1

The spectra have been recorded at a resolution of 0.02cm-1 and a range of temperatures from 223 to 283 K. The resulting data show good agreement with the harmonic frequencies and intensities calculated using density functional theory as well as with the integrated absorption intensities of the spectral bands available in the literature. The new cross-sections will allow more accurate retrieval of atmospheric HCFC-142b concentrations using infrared spectroscopic techniques.		1

The results are applied to 15 chemistry climate models (CCMs) participating in the 2010 World Meteorological Organization ozone assessment. Comparison of the observed and simulated N2O, mean age and their compact correlation identifies models with fast or slow circulations and reveals details of model ascent and tropical isolation. This process-oriented diagnostic is more useful than mean age alone because it identifies models with compensating transport deficiencies that produce fortuitous agreement with mean age. The diagnosed model transport behavior is related to a model's ability to produce realistic lower stratosphere (LS) O3 profiles. Models with the greatest tropical transport problems compare poorly with O3 observations. Models with the most realistic LS transport agree more closely with LS observations and each other. We incorporate the results of the chemistry evaluations in the Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) CCMVal Report to explain the range of CCM predictions for the return-to-1980 dates for global (60°S–60°N) and Antarctic column ozone. Antarctic O3 return dates are generally correlated with vortex Cly levels, and vortex Cly is generally correlated with the model's circulation, although model Cl chemistry and conservation problems also have a significant effect on return date. In both regions, models with good LS transport and chemistry produce a smaller range of predictions for the return-to-1980 ozone values. This study suggests that the current range of predicted return dates is unnecessarily broad due to identifiable model deficiencies.		1

The kinetic temperatures and CO2 volume mixing ratios (VMRs) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have been simultaneously retrieved using SABER limb radiances at 15 and 4.3 µm under nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. This paper presents results of a validation study of the SABER CO2 VMRs obtained with a two-channel, self-consistent temperature/CO2 retrieval algorithm. Results are based on comparisons with coincident CO2 measurements made by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and simulations using the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). The SABER CO2 VMRs are in agreement with ACE-FTS observations within reported systematic uncertainties from 65 to 110 km. The annual average SABER CO2 VMR falls off from a well-mixed value above ~80 km. Latitudinal and seasonal variations of CO2 VMRs are substantial. SABER observations and the SD-WACCM simulations are in overall agreement for CO2 seasonal variations, as well as global distributions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Not surprisingly, the CO2 seasonal variation is shown to be driven by the general circulation, converging in the summer polar mesopause region and diverging in the winter polar mesopause region.		1

The CO 2 data show a trend of ~5% per decade at\r\n~80 km and below, in good agreement with the tropospheric trend observed at Mauna Loa. Above 80 km, the\r\nSABER CO 2 trend is larger than in the lower atmosphere, reaching ~12% per decade at 110 km. The large\r\nrelative trend in the upper atmosphere is consistent with results from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment\r\nFourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). On the other hand, the CO 2 trend deduced from the Whole\r\nAtmosphere Community Climate Model remains close to 5% everywhere. The spatial coverage of the SABER\r\ninstrument allows us to analyze the CO 2 trend as a function of latitude for the first time. The trend is larger in\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere mesopause above 80 km. The agreement\r\nbetween SABER and ACE-FTS suggests that the rate of increase of CO 2 in the upper atmosphere over the past\r\n13 years is considerably larger than can be explained by chemistry-climate models.		1

Its two instruments measure vertical profiles of over 30 atmospheric trace gases by analyzing solar occultation spectra in the ultraviolet/visible and infrared wavelength regions. The reservoir gases HNO3, ClONO2, and N2O5 are three of the key species provided by the primary instrument, the ACE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). This paper describes the ACE-FTS version 2.2 data products, including the N2O5 update, for the three species and presents validation comparisons with available observations. We have compared volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles of HNO3, ClONO2, and N2O5 with measurements by other satellite instruments (SMR, MLS, MIPAS), aircraft measurements (ASUR), and single balloon-flights (SPIRALE, FIRS-2). Partial columns of HNO3 and ClONO2 were also compared with measurements by ground-based Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers. Overall the quality of the ACE-FTS v2.2 HNO3 VMR profiles is good from 18 to 35 km. For the statistical satellite comparisons, the mean absolute differences are generally within ±1 ppbv ±20%) from 18 to 35 km. For MIPAS and MLS comparisons only, mean relative differences lie within±10% between 10 and 36 km. ACE-FTS HNO3 partial columns (~15–30 km) show a slight negative bias of −1.3% relative to the ground-based FTIRs at latitudes ranging from 77.8° S–76.5° N. Good agreement between ACE-FTS ClONO2 and MIPAS, using the Institut für Meteorologie und Klimaforschung and Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IMK-IAA) data processor is seen. Mean absolute differences are typically within ±0.01 ppbv between 16 and 27 km and less than +0.09 ppbv between 27 and 34 km. The ClONO2 partial column comparisons show varying degrees of agreement, depending on the location and the quality of the FTIR measurements. Good agreement was found for the comparisons with the midlatitude Jungfraujoch partial columns for which the mean relative difference is 4.7%. ACE-FTS N2O5 has a low bias relative to MIPAS IMK-IAA, reaching −0.25 ppbv at the altitude of the N2O5 maximum (around 30 km). Mean absolute differences at lower altitudes (16–27 km) are typically −0.05 ppbv for MIPAS nighttime and ±0.02 ppbv for MIPAS daytime measurements.		1

The instrument successfully participated in a large Arctic aircraft campaign within the RECONCILE (Reconciliation of essential process parameters for an enhanced predictability of Arctic stratospheric ozone loss and its climate interactions) project in Kiruna (Sweden) from January to March 2010. \r\n\r\nThis paper concentrates on the measurements taken during one flight of the campaign, which took place on 2 March in the vicinity of the polar vortex. We present two-dimensional cross-sections of derived volume mixing ratios for the trace gases CFC-11, O3, and ClONO2 with an unprecedented vertical resolution of about 500 to 600 m for a large part of the observed altitude range (≈ 6–19 km) and a dense horizontal sampling along flight direction of ≈ 15 km. The trace gas distributions show several structures, for example a part of the polar vortex and a vortex filament, which can be identified by means of O3–CFC-11 tracer–tracer correlations. \r\n\r\nThe observations made during this flight are interpreted using the chemistry and transport model CLaMS (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere). Comparisons of the observations with the model results are used to assess the performance of the model with respect to advection, mixing, and the chemistry in the polar vortex. These comparisons confirm the capability of CLaMS to reproduce even very small-scale structures in the atmosphere, which partly have a vertical extent of only 1 km. Based on the good agreement between simulation and observation, we use artificial (passive) tracers, which represent different air mass origins (e.g. vortex, tropics), to further analyse the CRISTA-NF observations in terms of the composition of air mass origins. These passive tracers clearly illustrate the observation of filamentary structures that include tropical air masses. A characteristic of the Arctic winter 2009/10 was a sudden stratospheric warming in December that led to a split of the polar vortex. The vortex re-established at the end of December. Our passive tracer simulations suggest that large parts of the re-established vortex consisted to about 45% of high- and mid-latitude air.		1

The focus of this study is to present the retrieval methodology including the sensitivity studies and optimizations for the implementation of the radiative transfer model on SCIAMACHY lunar occultation measurements. The study also includes the validation of the data product with the collocated measurements from two satellite occultation instruments and two instruments measuring in limb geometry. The SCIAMACHY lunar occultation water vapor measurement comparisons with the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer) instrument have shown an agreement of 5% on the average that is well within the reported biases of ACE in the stratosphere. The comparisons with HALOE (Halogen Occultation Experiment) have also shown good results where the agreement between the instruments is within 5%. The validations of the lunar occultation water vapor measurements with MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) instrument are exceptionally good, varying between 1.5 to around 4%. The validations with MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) are in the range of 10%. A validated dataset of water vapor vertical distributions from SCIAMACHY lunar occultation measurements is expected to facilitate the understanding of physical and chemical processes in the southern mid-latitudes and the dynamical processes related to the polar vortex.		1

During the International Polar Year (IPY) springs of 2007 and 2008, three ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers were operated simultaneously. This paper presents a comparison of trace gas measurements of stratospherically important species involved in ozone depletion, namely O3, HCl, ClONO2, HNO3 and HF, recorded with these three spectrometers. Total column densities of the gases measured with the new Canadian Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC) Bruker 125HR are shown to agree to within 3.5% with the existing Environment Canada Bomem DA8 measurements. After smoothing both of these sets of measurements to account for the lower spectral resolution of the University of Waterloo Portable Atmospheric Research Interferometric Spectrometer for the Infrared (PARIS-IR), the measurements were likewise shown to agree with PARIS-IR to within 7%. Concurrent measurements of these gases were also made with the satellite-based Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) during overpasses of Eureka during these time periods. While one of the mandates of the ACE satellite mission is to study ozone depletion in the polar spring, previous validation exercises have identified the highly variable polar vortex conditions of the spring period to be a challenge for validation efforts. In this work, comparisons between the CANDAC Bruker 125HR and ACE-FTS have been used to develop strict criteria that allow the ground- and satellite-based instruments to be confidently compared. When these criteria are taken into consideration, the observed biases between the ACE-FTS and ground-based FTIR spectrometer are not persistent for both years and are generally insignificant, though small positive biases of ~5%, comparable in magnitude to those seen in previous validation exercises, are observed for HCl and HF in 2007, and negative biases of −15.3%, −4.8% and −1.5% are seen for ClONO2, HNO3 and O3 in 2008.		1

To benefit from their diversity, we have simulated spectra of a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS), working in the middle to far infrared and of a grating spectrometer (GA) working in the middle infrared. As control runs, non-synergistic retrievals were performed as well. Two molecules of interest in the Martian atmosphere were chosen to test this method: carbon monoxide and methane. Scenarios were selected and two different vibrational bands for each molecule were used to retrieve molecular volume mixing ratios. Synergistic retrievals for CO are useful both in solar occultation and in nadir, while for CH4, the concentration of which is expected to be very low, the results for FTS and GA in synergy are not as conclusive due to the weak signal in the ν4 vibrational band (covered by FTS) compared to the stronger ν3 band (covered by GA). Our results represent a first step to an optimized use of infrared spectra to be recorded in Martian orbit by two instruments of EMTGO.		1

ACE-FTS has been used to measure the change in concentration between 2004 and 2010 of CCl4, CF4, CCl3F (CFC-11), CCl2F2 (CFC-12), C2Cl3F3 (CFC-113), CH3Cl, ClONO2, COF2, COCl2, COClF, CHF2Cl (HCFC-22), CH3CCl2F (HCFC-141b), CH3CClF2 (HCFC-142b), HCl, HF and SF6 between 30°N and 30°S. ACE-FTS measurements were compared to surface measurements made by the AGAGE network and output from the SLIMCAT three-dimensional (3-D) chemical transport model, which is constrained by similar surface data. ACE-FTS measurements of CFCs show declining trends which agree with both AGAGE and SLIMCAT values. There are problems with the ACE-FTS retrievals of CFC-113 and HCFCs, with work currently ongoing to correct these problems. At lower altitudes the volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these species increase with altitude. This is due to problems with the retrievals at high beta angle (the angle between the orbital plane and the Earth–Sun vector). Although some of the retrievals have problems, we are confident that the trends are generally reliable. The concentrations of HCFCs appear to be increasing with ACE-FTS, SLIMCAT and AGAGE all showing positive trends. ACE-FTS measurements of the decomposition products (COFCl and COCl2) do not show any significant trends. SLIMCAT data show a negative trend for COFCl which corresponds to the decrease in CFC-11, its assumed major source, during this time. COF2 measurements from ACE-FTS show an increasing trend, while SLIMCAT shows a decreasing trend again linked to its assumed production from CFCs. ClONO2 is highly photosensitive, thus the ACE-FTS occultations have been divided into local morning and evening occultations. Evening measurements of ClONO2 show a decreasing trend in VMR, while morning measurements show an increasing trend. The reason for this difference is not understood at this time. The SLIMCAT output used in this study was not saved as local sunrise and sunset: therefore, only 24 h mean fields are available for ClONO2. These SLIMCAT data show a decreasing trend. SLIMCAT and ACE-FTS both show an increasing trend in the VMR of HF and a decreasing trend in the VMR of HCl. These results illustrate the success of the Montreal Protocol in reducing ozone depleting substances. The reduction in anthropogenic chlorine emissions has led to a decrease in the VMR of stratospheric HCl. The replacement of CFCs with HCFCs has led to an increase in the VMR of HF in the stratosphere. As chlorine-containing compounds continue to be phased out and replaced by fluorine-containing molecules, it is likely that total atmospheric fluorine will continue increasing in the near future.		1

For the sample period of 8–9 May 2005, Southern Hemisphere, limb radiance profiles of continuum spectra, resolved from OH airglow and auroral contamination, are inverted to obtain volume emission rate altitude profiles. The maximum observed differential brightness referred to zenith viewing is 1.2 × 107 photons cm−2 s−1 nm−1 at 580 nm with a measurement uncertainty 5 × 105 photons cm−2 s−1 nm−1, for an analysis range 80–101 km. Atomic oxygen densities [O] required by the analysis to derive NO densities [NO] are determined from OSIRIS O2(b1Σg+ − X3Σg−) 0-0 band night airglow observations and from Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) sunset ozone observations. The derived Southern Hemisphere [O] map that shows pronounced longitudinal variation, maximum of 7 × 1011 cm−3, considerably exceeding MSIS model values, and suggests significant dynamical influence. Combining the continuum observations and the derived [O], a hemispheric map of derived [NO] is assembled that also shows considerable spatial variation, maximum of 1.1 × 109 cm−3, measurement uncertainty of 3 × 107 cm−3. Comparing the two maps, the geographical distribution of [NO] differs considerably from that of [O]. From a qualitative comparison, the distribution of derived [NO] is similar to that in coordinated GUVI LBH1 auroral precipitation images.

It has been making atmospheric observations since 12 October 2009 with the aid of a 4 K mechanical cooler and superconducting mixers for submillimeter limb-emission sounding in the frequency bands of 624.32–626.32 GHz and 649.12–650.32 GHz . On the basis of the observed spectra, the data processing has been retrieving vertical profiles for the atmospheric minor constituents in the middle atmosphere, such as O3 with isotopes, HCl, ClO, HO2, BrO, and HNO3. Results from SMILES have demonstrated its high potential to observe atmospheric minor constituents in the middle atmosphere. Unfortunately, SMILES observations have been suspended since 21 April 2010 owing to the failure of a critical component.		1

A global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) is used to guide the evaluation and to relate sparse in situ measurements with the satellite retrievals. Both satellite retrievals generally reproduce broad ozone features in the upper troposphere such as summer enhancements in the northern subtropics and larger concentrations over the tropical Atlantic versus the tropical Pacific. These comparisons indicate biases in annual, tropical mean ozone concentrations from both ACE-FTS (10–13%) and OSIRIS (5%) relative to aircraft and ozonesonde observations. More uncertain evidence suggests that nitric acid from ACE-FTS has a positive mean bias of 15%. We demonstrate that an upper limit on the ozone production efficiency in the upper troposphere can be determined using ACE-FTS satellite measurements of O3 and HNO3. The resulting value of 196 (+34, −61) mol/mol is in broad agreement with model simulations. Higher OPE values inferred from ACE-FTS over the tropical Pacific (249 (+21, −68) mol/mol) than the tropical Atlantic (146 (+16, −41) mol/mol) reflect increasing ozone production efficiency with decreasing pollution. This analysis indicates a new capability of satellite observations to provide insight into ozone production in the tropical troposphere.		1

The relationship is found to hold at different altitudes as well as in the column. The use of a PSC formation threshold based on temperature dependent cold aerosol formation makes little difference to the original, empirical relationship. Analysis of the photochemistry leading to the ozone loss shows that activation is limited by the photolysis of nitric acid. This step produces nitrogen dioxide which is converted to chlorine nitrate which in turn reacts with hydrogen chloride on any polar stratospheric clouds to form active chlorine. The rate-limiting step is the photolysis of nitric acid: this occurs at the same rate every year and so the interannual variation in the ozone loss is caused by the extent and persistence of the polar stratospheric clouds. In early spring the ozone loss rate increases as the solar insolation increases the photolysis of the chlorine monoxide dimer in the near ultraviolet. However the length of the ozone loss period is determined by the photolysis of nitric acid which also occurs in the near ultraviolet. As a result of these compensating effects, the amount of the ozone loss is principally limited by the extent of original activation rather than its timing. In addition a number of factors, including the vertical changes in pressure and total inorganic chlorine as well as denitrification and renitrification, offset each other. As a result the extent of original activation is the most important factor influencing ozone loss. These results indicate that relatively simple parameterisations of Arctic ozone loss could be developed for use in coupled chemistry climate models.		1

For the climate model simulations, we placed all the SO2 into the lower stratosphere. The temporal and spatial distribution of model predictions of sulfate aerosol optical depth agrees with measurements made by the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS), a Canadian satellite instrument. After accounting for differences due to different wavelengths, different sampling volumes, and an overestimate of stratospheric SO2 loading in the model, the optical depths measured by OSIRIS are consistent with the modeled values. Although the shortwave radiative effects of the eruption are detectable in model output, perturbations in surface air temperature and precipitation were negligible, since the Okmok injection was quite small and the Kasatochi eruption was too late in the year for there to have been large radiative forcing in 2008 and was of insufficient magnitude for the sulfate aerosols to persist in the stratosphere into the following spring. We conducted further experiments with lower stratospheric injections of 3 and 5 Tg of SO2 into the Arctic on August 8, 2008. Although the sulfate aerosol optical depth and resulting shortwave radiative forcing increase linearly with atmospheric loading of SO2, the radiative forcing was still small due to the timing of the eruption, with little insolation by the time the sulfate aerosol cloud would form. High latitude eruptions of this size occurring in August or later in the calendar year would still be of insufficient magnitude for the sulfate aerosols to persist in the stratosphere into the following spring, and climate effects would be negligible.		1

Using the optimal estimation method, typically over a limited spectral region called a microwindow, information about the vertical distribution of trace gas species that have absorption bands in the mid-infrared spectral range can be retrieved. Total and partial columns can also be determined to show the temporal evolution of the target gas. For ozone in particular, retrievals have been performed using several of its many mid-infrared absorption features, resulting in a lack of consistency in the literature in the microwindows chosen for retrievals. This work focuses on the optimization of the ozone retrieval, assessing a set of 22 microwindows between 780 and 3052 cm−1 to determine which is best suited to conditions at Eureka. The 1000–1004.5 cm−1 spectral interval is shown to be the most sensitive to both the stratosphere and troposphere. This microwindow gives the highest number of degrees of freedom for signal (∼7 for total column), and the smallest total error (4.3%) compared with 21 other spectral regions. Retrievals performed with this microwindow agree well with results obtained from other instruments on-site. Total column ozone measured by the Bruker 125HR in this microwindow agreed to 2% with two other Fourier transform spectrometers, to 0.7% with a Brewer spectrophotometer, to 8% with a SAOZ UV–VIS spectrometer, and to 7% with ozone sondes.		1

The retrieval scheme uses new quantitative laboratory spectroscopic measurements of acetonitrile (Harrison and Bernath, 2012). Although individual ACE-FTS profile measurements are dominated by measurement noise, median profiles in 10° latitude bins show a steady decline in volume mixing ratio from ~150 ppt (parts per trillion) at 11.5 km to < 40 ppt at 25.5–29.5 km. These new measurements agree well with the scant available air- and balloon-borne data in the lower stratosphere. An acetonitrile stratospheric lifetime of 73 ± 20 yr has been determined.		1

The CO measurements were obtained during North American (NASA ARCTAS and NOAA ARCPAC) and European campaigns (POLARCAT-France, POLARCAT-GRACE and YAK-AEROSIB) as part of the International Polar Year (IPY) POLARCAT activity in spring and summer 2008. During the campaigns different air masses were sampled including clean air, polluted plumes originating from anthropogenic sources in Europe, Asia and North America, and forest fire plumes originating from Siberia and Canada. The paper illustrates that CO-rich plumes following different transport pathways were well captured by the IASI instrument, in particular due to the high spatial coverage of IASI. The comparison between IASI CO total columns, 0–5 km partial columns and profiles with collocated aircraft data was achieved by taking into account the different sensitivity and geometry of the sounding instruments. A detailed analysis is provided and the agreement is discussed in terms of information content and surface properties at the location of the observations. For profiles, the data were found to be in good agreement in spring with differences lower than 17%, whereas in summer the difference can reach 20% for IASI profiles below 8 km for polluted cases. For total columns the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.15 to 0.74 (from 0.47 to 0.77 for partial columns) in spring and from 0.26 to 0.84 (from 0.66 to 0.88 for partial columns) in summer. A better agreement is seen over the sea in spring (0.73 for total column and 0.78 for partial column) and over the land in summer (0.69 for total columns and 0.81 for partial columns). The IASI vertical sensitivity was better over land than over sea, and better over land than over sea ice and snow allowing a higher potential to detect CO vertical distribution during summer.		1

A total of 8809 ACE occultations measured between 2004 and 2010 have been processed, along with 24 MkIV occultations measured between 1989 and 2007. ACE data (yearly averages over the 10–25 km altitude range) in the tropics/subtropics (40°S–40°N) reveal a trend of 4.0 ± 1.6% per year in the growth of HFC-23 for 2004–2009 (or 3.9 ± 1.2% per year for 2004–2010), slightly smaller than surface measurements from Cape Grim air archive samples over the same time period (4.7 ± 0.3% per year). The northern midlatitude and high-latitude MkIV data (averaged over the 10–25 km altitude range) indicate a growth rate of 5.8 ± 0.3% per year over the period 1989–2007 (5.3 ± 0.4% per year for just the midlatitude data), similar to the Cape Grim surface trend of 5.7 ± 0.1% per year over the same period. The absolute HFC-23 volume mixing ratios measured by ACE and MkIV in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere are in good agreement (<5% bias) with each other but are ∼30% larger than ground-based measurements. The source of this bias has not been definitively ascertained; however, spectroscopic errors are the most likely cause.		1

This phenomenon, referred to as “atmospheric tape recorder” has previously been observed for water vapor, CO2, and CO which exhibit an annual cycle. Recently, based on Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) satellite measurements, the tape recorder signal has been observed for hydrogen cyanide (HCN) but with an approximately two-year period. Here we report on a model simulation of the HCN tape recorder for the time period 2002–2008 using the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). The model can reproduce the observed pattern of the HCN tape recorder signal if time-resolved emissions from fires in Indonesia are used as lower boundary condition. This finding indicates that inter-annual variations in biomass burning in Indonesia, which are strongly influenced by El Niño events, control the HCN tape recorder signal. A longer time series of tropical HCN data will probably exhibit an irregular cycle rather than a regular biannual cycle.		1

Here, we identify the transport of air masses from the surface, through the Asian monsoon, and deep into the stratosphere, using satellite observations of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a tropospheric pollutant produced in biomass burning. A key factor in this identification is that HCN has a strong sink from contact with the ocean; much of the air in the tropical upper troposphere is relatively depleted in HCN, and hence, broad tropical upwelling cannot be the main source for the stratosphere. The monsoon circulation provides an effective pathway for pollution from Asia, India, and Indonesia to enter the global stratosphere.		1

The Superconducting Sub-Millimeter-Wave Limb Emission Sounder (SMILES) instrument in the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) on the International Space Station monitors H2O2 using the pure rotational JKa,Kc=201,19–192,17 transition at 625.044 GHz in the ground vibronic state. Accurate retrievals of H2O2 abundances rely on a knowledge of pressure broadening effects for this transition, and the required nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) broadening coefficients are measured here for the first time. Values of the pressure broadening coefficients, γ(N2)=4.03±0.06MHz/Torr and γ(O2)=2.49±0.04MHz/Torr are obtained at room temperature, with statistical 3σ uncertainties given. The value for air broadening is then derived to be γ(air)=3.71±0.09MHz/Torr, where the uncertainty includes possible systematic errors.		1

The retrieval relies on ro-vibrational absorption of solar radiation by water vapour in the 926–970 nm range. During the iterative inversion process, the optical depth spectra are simulated at the spectral resolution and sampling frequency of MAESTRO using the correlated-k approximation. The Chahine inversion updates the water vapour volume mixing ratio (VMR), adjusting all retrieval layers simultaneously, to match the observed differential optical depth due to absorption by water vapour and ozone at each tangent height. This approach accounts for significant line saturation effects. Profiles are typically obtained from ∼22 km down to the cloud tops or to 5 km, with relative precision as small as 3% in the troposphere. In the lower stratosphere, the precision on water vapour VMR is ∼1.3 μmol/mol in an individual retrieval layer (∼1 km thick). The spectral capability of MAESTRO allows for the clear separation of extinction due to water vapour and aerosol, and for the fitting quality to be quantified and used to determine an altitude-dependent convergence criterion for the retrieval. In the middle troposphere, interhemispheric differences in water vapour VMR are driven by oceanic evaporation whereas in the upper troposphere, deep convection dominates and a strong seasonal cycle is observed at high latitudes.		1

In September 2008, profiles of NIR extinction show a significant increase relative to each of the previous four Septembers (2004–2007). The aerosol enhancement is observable up to 18.5 km in Northern Hemisphere NIR extinction data, and peaks at 9.5 km in the extratropics, where the extinction is ∼8 times the normal September value. The particulate matter in the troposphere is quickly dispersed over the Northern Hemisphere during September 2008 and vanishes by the end of November 2008. An upper layer, initially in the extratropical lower stratosphere, persists through March 2009, descending with time into the troposphere where, by coagulation of sulphate aerosol, the size of the particles increases with time.		1

This technique benefits from a long optical path length and high signal strength, and can have high spectral resolution. The Martian atmosphere is often subject to large quantities of suspended dust, which attenuates solar radiation along the line-of-sight. An instrument making solar occultation measurements scans the limb of the atmosphere continuously, and the optical path moves through layers of increasing or decreasing dust levels during a single interferogram acquisition, resulting in time-varying signal intensity. If uncorrected, source intensity variations (SIVs) can affect the relative depth of absorption lines, negatively impacting trace gas retrievals. We have simulated SIVs using synthetic spectra for the Martian atmosphere, and investigated different techniques to mitigate the effects of SIVs. We examined high-pass filters in the wavenumber domain, and smoothing methods in the optical path difference (OPD) domain, and conclude that using a convolution operator in the OPD domain can isolate the SIVs and be used to correct for it. We observe spectral residuals of less than 0.25% in both high- and low-dust conditions, and retrieved volume mixing ratio vertical profile differences on the order of 0.5–3% for several trace gases known to be present in the Martian atmosphere. These differences are smaller than those caused by adding realistic noise to the spectra. This work thus demonstrates that it should be possible to retrieve vertical profiles of trace gases in a dusty Martian atmosphere using solar occultation if the interferograms are corrected for the effects of dust.		1

SOIR spectra through the Martian atmosphere have been simulated with ASIMUT, a line-by-line (LBL) radiative transfer code also used for the retrieval of vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents of Venus (Vandaele et al., 2008; Bertaux et al., 2007a). The code takes into account the temperature and pressure vertical profiles as well as those of the atmospheric species, but also the instrument function and the overlapping of the diffraction orders of the echelle grating. We will show these spectra and the detection limits of species that could be studied using a SOIR spectrometer making solar occultation or nadir measurements in Mars orbit.		1

The rocket was launched on January 31, 2008 at 19:14 UT, when auroral activity appeared after a long geomagnetically quiet period. In this paper we present an overview of the HotPay 2 measurements of upper mesospheric and lower thermospheric (UMLT) electron, atomic oxygen (O) and nitric oxide (NO) densities. [O] and [NO] were retrieved from a set of three photometers, Night-Time Emissions from the Mesosphere and Ionosphere (NEMI). Faraday rotation receivers on the rocket and the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter radar provided simultaneous electron density profiles, whereas the ALOMAR Na lidar and meteor radar measured the temperature profile and wind. The aurora was also observed with ground-based imagers.\r\n\r\nThe retrieved oxygen number density profile has a maximum at 89 km, some 10 km lower than expected from earlier measurements and modelled profiles based on climatological averages (such as the MSIS model), and the retrieved NO densities are also lower than the expected. Satellite measurements indicate that subsidence over the winter pole controlled the densities. Quantitative chemistry model results based on climatological average atmospheric density and temperature profiles were, therefore, not in good agreement with the measured profiles. The Hotel Payload 2 measurements thus confirm the importance of downward transport from the thermosphere into the winter polar vortex.		1

This newly developed S/T-CCM has been evaluated with various observations, and it shows good performance in simulating important chemical species and their interdependence in both the troposphere and stratosphere. The modeled total column ozone agrees well with Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer observations. Modeled ozone profiles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are significantly improved compared to runs with the stratospheric chemistry and tropospheric chemistry models alone, and they are in good agreement with Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding satellite ozone profiles. The observed CO tape recorder is also successfully captured by the new CCM, and ozone-CO correlations are in accordance with Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment observations. However, because of limitations in vertical resolution, intrusion of CO-rich air in the stratosphere from the mesosphere could not be simulated in the current version of S/T-CCM. Additionally, the simulated stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux, which controls upper tropospheric OH and O3 concentrations, is found to be more realistic in the new coupled model compared to STOCHEM.		1

The case of collisionally isolated transitions (no line mixing) is treated by considering only the effects of the speed dependence (SD) of the pressure broadening. The case of O3 retrievals from a sequence of limb transmission spectra is first treated theoretically. The results show that the influence of SD is very small, leading to changes in the residuals and in the retrieved O3 mixing ratios smaller than 1%. These findings are then confirmed by treating a series of spectra recorded by the ACE-FTS instrument. Similar exercises are also made for other observation techniques by treating simulated or measured limb and nadir emission spectra as well as ground-based solar and in-situ laser transmission data. All lead to the general conclusion that SD (and Dicke narrowing) can be neglected in retrievals of ozone amounts from recorded atmospheric spectra. Indeed, the biases caused in the ozone profiles by the use of pure Voigt line shapes still remain significantly smaller than the total error/uncertainty from other sources such as improper line intensities and widths, uncertainty in the instrument function, errors in the pressure and temperature profiles and so forth.		1

The instrument is mounted on the high-flying Russian research aircraft M55-Geophysica and measures limb-emissions in the mid-infrared region in the tangent altitude range of about 6 to 21 km. We present a new retrieval setup which is based on 9 integrated spectral windows allowing to retrieve an extended set of trace gases and temperature fields with high vertical resolution (up to 500 m). Retrieval results are shown for temperature, water vapor (H2O), ozone (O3), nitric acid (HNO3), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and aerosol extinction. Comparisons of temperature, O3, and H2O observations with corresponding in situ measurements on-board M55-Geophysica show reasonable agreement. In particular, CRISTA-NF observations in the vicinity of the aircraft resemble horizontal variations found in the in situ measurements better than corresponding ECMWF fields.		1

Lagrangian (trajectory-based) models have several important advantages over conventional Eulerian models, including the absence of spurious numerical diffusion, efficient code parallelization and no limitation of the largest time step by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy criterion. This work describes and validates the stratospheric chemistry scheme of the model. Stratospheric chemistry is simulated with ATLAS for the Arctic winter 1999/2000, with a focus on polar ozone depletion and denitrification. The simulations are used to validate the chemistry module in comparison with measurements of the SOLVE/THESEO 2000 campaign. A Lagrangian denitrification module, which is based on the simulation of the nucleation, sedimentation and growth of a large number of polar stratospheric cloud particles, is used to model the substantial denitrification that occured in this winter.		1

Methanol/dry synthetic air mixtures were prepared and spectra were recorded at 0.015 cm−1 resolution (calculated as 0.9/MOPD) at a number of temperatures and pressures (50–760 Torr and 204–296 K) appropriate for atmospheric conditions. Intensities were calibrated using composite methanol spectra taken from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) IR database. The new measurements in the 10 μm region indicate problems with the existing methanol spectroscopic line parameters in the HITRAN database, which will impact the accuracy of satellite retrievals.		1

These observations rely on spectroscopic parameters that are not known with sufficient accuracy to compute total columns that can be used in combination with in situ measurements. The TCCON must therefore be calibrated to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in situ trace gas measurement scales. We present a calibration of TCCON data using WMO-scale instrumentation aboard aircraft that measured profiles over four TCCON stations during 2008 and 2009. These calibrations are compared with similar observations made in 2004 and 2006. The results indicate that a single, global calibration factor for each gas accurately captures the TCCON total column data within error.		1

Accounting for this effect in the analysis of remote sensing measurements of Earth's atmosphere by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) yields reduced residuals, which leads to improved performance in the volume mixing ratio retrievals for some molecules. Analytical expressions are presented for the imaginary components of the polynomial ratios from the Humlicek algorithm, which provides approximate solutions to the complex probability function. These imaginary components are employed in the calculation of line mixing using the Rosenkranz first order approximation. Examples of line mixing in ACE measurements are presented, including a set of CH4 lines that exhibit both line mixing and speed dependence. An efficient, analytical approach is proposed for calculating line shapes with a combination of line mixing and speed dependence. FORTRAN routines for calculating line mixing effects are provided as a supplement to the paper.		1

Limb viewing spaceborne sounders such as the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) offer a vertical resolution of a few kilometres for profiles, which is much better than currently flying or planned nadir sounding instruments can achieve. After having demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining CO2 vertical profiles in the 5–25 km altitude range with an accuracy of about 2 ppm in a previous study, we present here the results of five years of ACE-FTS observations in terms of monthly mean profiles of CO2 averaged over 10° latitude bands for northern mid-latitudes. These results are compared with in-situ aircraft measurements and with simulations from two different air transport models. Key features of the measured altitude distribution of CO2 are shown to be accurately reproduced by the ACE-FTS retrievals: variation in altitude of the seasonal cycle amplitude and extrema, seasonal change of the vertical gradient, and mean growth rate. We show that small but significant differences from model simulations could result from an over estimation of the model circulation strength during the northern hemisphere spring. Coupled with column measurements from a nadir viewing instrument, it is expected that occultation measurements will bring useful constraints to the surface carbon flux determination.		1

The retrievals of ethane and ethyne from ACE have been improved for this paper by using new sets of microwindows compared with those for previous versions of ACE data. With the improved ethyne retrieval we have been able to produce a near global upper tropospheric distribution of C2H2 from space. Carbon monoxide, ethane and ethyne concentrations retrieved using ACE spectra show the expected seasonality linked to variations in the anthropogenic emissions and destruction rates as well as seasonal biomass burning activity. The GEOS-Chem model was run using the dicarbonyl chemistry suite, an extended chemical mechanism in which ethyne is treated explicitly. Seasonal cycles observed from satellite data are well reproduced by the model output, however the simulated CO concentrations are found to be systematically biased low over the Northern Hemisphere. An average negative global mean bias of 12% and 7% of the model relative to the satellite observations has been found for CO and C2H6 respectively and a positive global mean bias of 1% has been found for C2H2. ACE data are compared for validation purposes with MkIV spectrometer data and Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) TRACE-A campaign data showing good agreement with all of them.		1

It was proposed that the dissociation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on ice surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds plays the dominant role in forming the ozone hole. Efforts have been made to predict polar ozone loss in future years. It was further proposed that CFCs and cosmic-ray-driven ozone depletion may control global surface temperatures. These assertions challenge the fundamental understanding of Antarctic stratospheric ozone loss and global warming. Here we show that these arguments based on the CRE mechanism are inconclusive. First, correlations of satellite data of CFC-12, N2O and CH4 from ACE-FTS show no evidence of significant loss of CFC-12 as predicted by the CRE mechanism. Second, conclusions drawn about a possible CRE impact on the atmosphere, based on correlations of different observed atmospheric parameters, do not have a physical basis. Finally, predictions on the future development of the atmosphere based on these correlations are not reliable for either the ozone hole or global surface temperatures.		1

After reaching a minimum, ozone mixing ratios increase to above 1 ppmv on the 70 hPa level by late December. While the basic mechanisms causing the ozone hole have been known for more than 20 yr, the detailed chemical processes determining how low the local concentration can fall, and how it recovers from the minimum have not been explored so far. Both of these aspects are investigated here by analysing results from the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). As ozone falls below about 0.5 ppmv, a balance is maintained by gas phase production of both HCl and HOCl followed by heterogeneous reaction between these two compounds in these simulations. Thereafter, a very rapid, irreversible chlorine deactivation into HCl can occur, either when ozone drops to values low enough for gas phase HCl production to exceed chlorine activation processes or when temperatures increase above the polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) threshold. As a consequence, the timing and mixing ratio of the minimum ozone depends sensitively on model parameters, including the ozone initialisation. The subsequent ozone increase between October and December is linked mainly to photochemical ozone production, caused by oxygen photolysis and by the oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane.		1

We create HCl and ClO time series using satellite data sets extended to November 2008, so that an update can be made on the long term evolution of these two species. We use the HALogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) data for the HCl analysis, and the Odin Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR) and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (Aura-MLS) measurements for the study of ClO. Altitudes between 35 and 45 km and two mid-latitude bands: 30° S–50° S and 30° N–50° N, for HCl, and 20° S–20° N for ClO and HCl are studied. ACE-FTS and HALOE HCl anomaly time series (with QBO and seasonal contributions removed) are combined to produce all instrument average time series, which show HCl to be reducing from peak 1997 values at a linear estimated rate of −5.1 % decade−1 in the Northern Hemisphere and −5.2 % decade−1 in the Southern Hemisphere, while the tropics show a linear trend of −5.8 % per decade (although we do not remove the QBO contribution there due to sparse data). Trend values are significantly different from a zero trend at the 2 sigma level. ClO is decreasing in the tropics by −7.1 % ± 7.8 % decade−1 based on measurements made from December 2001 to November 2008. The statistically significant downward trend found in HCl after 1997 and the apparent downward ClO trend since 2001 (although not statistically significant) confirm how effective the 1987 Montreal protocol objectives and its amendments have been in reducing the total amount of inorganic chlorine.		1

From June 2002 to March 2004 MIPAS performed measurements in the full spectral resolution mode. To assess the quality of the HDO data set obtained during that period comparisons with measurements by Odin/SMR and SCISAT/ACE-FTS were performed. Comparisons were made on profile-to-profile basis as well as using seasonal and monthly averages. All in all the comparisons yield favourable results. The largest deviations between MIPAS and ACE-FTS are observed below 15 km, where relative deviations can occasionally exceed 100%. Despite these deviations in the absolute amount of HDO the latitudinal structures observed by both instruments are consistent in this altitude range. Between 15 km and 20 km there is less good agreement, in particular in the Antarctic during winter and spring. Also in the tropics some deviations are found. Above 20 km there is a high consistency in the structures observed by all three instruments. MIPAS and ACE-FTS typically agree within 10%, with MIPAS mostly showing higher abundances than ACE-FTS. Both data sets show considerably more HDO than SMR. This bias can be explained basically by uncertainties in spectroscopic parameters. Above 40 km, where the MIPAS HDO retrieval reaches its limits, still good agreement with the structures observed by SMR is found for most seasons. This puts some confidence in the MIPAS data at these altitudes.		1

A detailed characterization of multiple tropopauses accompanies the jet characterization. Jet climatologies show the well-known high altitude subtropical and lower altitude polar jets in the upper troposphere, as well as a pattern of concentric polar and subtropical jets in the Southern Hemisphere, and shifts of the primary jet to high latitudes associated with blocking ridges in Northern Hemisphere winter. The jet-coordinate view segregates air masses differently than the commonly-used equivalent latitude (EqL) coordinate throughout the lowermost stratosphere and in the upper troposphere. Mapping O3 data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite and the Winter Storms aircraft datasets in jet coordinates thus emphasizes different aspects of the circulation compared to an EqL-coordinate framework: the jet coordinate reorders the data geometrically, thus highlighting the strong PV, tropopause height and trace gas gradients across the subtropical jet, whereas EqL is a dynamical coordinate that may blur these spatial relationships but provides information on irreversible transport. The jet coordinate view identifies the concentration of stratospheric ozone well below the tropopause in the region poleward of and below the jet core, as well as other transport features associated with the upper tropospheric jets. Using the jet information in EqL coordinates allows us to study trace gas distributions in regions of weak versus strong jets, and demonstrates weaker transport barriers in regions with less jet influence. MLS and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer trace gas fields for spring 2008 in jet coordinates show very strong, closely correlated, PV, tropopause height and trace gas gradients across the jet, and evidence of intrusions of stratospheric air below the tropopause below and poleward of the subtropical jet; these features are consistent between instruments and among multiple trace gases. Our characterization of the jets is facilitating studies that will improve our understanding of upper tropospheric trace gas evolution.		1

The ozone profiles were derived from level-1b data of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) by means of the scientific level-2 processor run by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK). All trend and drift analyses were performed using a multilinear parametric trend model which includes a linear term, several harmonics with period lengths from 3 to 24 months and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Drifts at 2-sigma significance level were mainly negative for ozone relative to Aura MLS and Odin OSIRIS and negative or near zero for most of the comparisons to lidar measurements. Lidar stations used here include those at Hohenpeissenberg (47.8° N, 11.0° E), Lauder (45.0° S, 169.7° E), Mauna Loa (19.5° N, 155.6° W), Observatoire Haute Provence (43.9° N, 5.7° E) and Table Mountain (34.4° N, 117.7° W). Drifts against the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) were found to be mostly insignificant. The assessed MIPAS ozone trends cover the time period of July 2002 to April 2012 and range from −0.56 ppmv decade−1 to +0.48 ppmv decade−1 (−0.52 ppmv decade−1 to +0.47 ppmv decade−1 when displayed on pressure coordinates) depending on altitude/pressure and latitude. From the empirical drift analyses we conclude that the real ozone trends might be slightly more positive/less negative than those calculated from the MIPAS data, by conceding the possibility of MIPAS having a very small (approximately within −0.3 ppmv decade−1) negative drift for ozone. This leads to drift-corrected trends of −0.41 ppmv decade−1 to +0.55 ppmv decade−1 (−0.38 ppmv decade−1 to +0.53 ppmv decade−1 when displayed on pressure coordinates) for the time period covered by MIPAS Envisat measurements, with very few negative and large areas of positive trends at mid-latitudes for both hemispheres around and above 30 km (~10 hPa). Negative trends are found in the tropics around 25 and 35 km (~25 and 5 hPa), while an area of positive trends is located right above the tropical tropopause. These findings are in good agreement with the recent literature. Differences of the trends compared with the recent literature could be explained by a possible shift of the subtropical mixing barriers. Results for the altitude–latitude distribution of amplitudes of the quasi-biennial, annual and the semi-annual oscillation are overall in very good agreement with recent findings.		1

This paper gives a brief overview of the solar occultation measurement technique followed by a detailed discussion of the mechanisms that make the measurement sensitive to temperature. Methods for retrieving T(P) using both broadband transmittance and refraction are discussed. Investigations using measurements of broadband transmittance in two CO2 absorption bands (the 4.3 and 2.7 μm bands) and refractive bending are then presented. These investigations include sensitivity studies, simulated retrieval studies, and examples from SOFIE.		1

A balloon campaign was simultaneously conducted to calibrate and validate the new lidar water vapor measurements. Initial results show that height-resolved profiles up to 10 km with better than 10% error are obtained with 30-min integration and 250-m height resolution. Comparison of the lidar observations with water vapor profiles retrieved by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on board the Aqua satellite agree within the error associated with each measurement. These new observations offer more routine measurements of water vapor in the Arctic to complement measurements related to the Arctic’s hydrologic cycle.		1

Our bottom-up estimate of the global source of formic and acetic acids are ~1200 and ~1400 Gmol yr−1, dominated by photochemical oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds, in particular isoprene. Their sinks are dominated by wet and dry deposition. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to evaluate this budget against an extensive suite of measurements from ground, ship and satellite-based Fourier transform spectrometers, as well as from several aircraft campaigns over North America. The model captures the seasonality of formic and acetic acids well but generally underestimates their concentration, particularly in the Northern midlatitudes. We infer that the source of both carboxylic acids may be up to 50% greater than our estimate and report evidence for a long-lived missing secondary source of carboxylic acids that may be associated with the aging of organic aerosols. Vertical profiles of formic acid in the upper troposphere support a negative temperature dependence of the reaction between formic acid and the hydroxyl radical as suggested by several theoretical studies.		1

Two different in physical nature spectral bands of water ice, the libration band near 850 cm−1 and O-H stretch band at 3200 cm−1, are used simultaneously. The use of both bands in the unified least squares fitting procedure enables one to enhance the stability of fitting, as well as to improve the reliability and accuracy of retrieved ice temperature values. A set of reference spectra for the least squares minimization is compiled from experimental temperature-dependent optical constants for water ice that are available in the literature. The method is applied to the observations made by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) instrument on board the SCISAT-1 satellite. According to our results, a combination of the vibration (3200 cm−1) and rotation (850 cm−1) bands within a unified minimization procedure can significantly, by about 4K, reduce the upper estimate of the total uncertainty in the retrieved temperatures from 12 K down to 8 K. The average temperature of bright mesospheric ice clouds observed by ACE-FTS during July 2005 is found to be about 131K, in contrast to the value of 135K retrieved from the vibration band alone.		1

First results using measurements from SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY) aboard ENVISAT (Environmental Satellite) are presented here. In previous publications, the retrieval of water vapor vertical distributions has been achieved exploiting either the emitted radiance leaving the atmosphere or the transmitted solar radiation. In this study, the scattered solar radiation is used as a new source of information on the water vapor content in the UTLS region. A recently developed retrieval algorithm utilizes the differential absorption structure of the water vapor in 1353–1410 nm spectral range and yields the water vapor content in the 11–25 km altitude range. In this study, the retrieval algorithm is successfully applied to SCIAMACHY limb measurements and the resulting water vapor profiles are compared to in situ balloon-borne observations. The results from both satellite and balloon-borne instruments are found to agree typically within 10 %.		1

Our chemistry-climate model (CCM) of the lower and middle atmosphere with aerosol module realistically simulates the background stratospheric sulphur cycle, as observed by satellites in volcanically quiescent periods. The model results indicate that upward transport of COS from the troposphere largely controls the sulphur budget and the aerosol loading of the background stratosphere. This differs from most previous studies which indicated that short-lived sulphur gases are also important. The model realistically simulates the modulation of the particulate and gaseous sulphur abundance in the stratosphere by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). In the lowermost stratosphere organic carbon aerosol contributes significantly to extinction. Further, using a chemical radiative convective model and recent spectra, we compute that the direct radiative forcing efficiency by 1 kg of COS is 724 times that of 1 kg CO2. Considering an anthropogenic fraction of 30% (derived from ice core data), this translates into an overall direct radiative forcing by COS of 0.003 W m−2. The direct global warming potentials of COS over time horizons of 20 and 100 yr are GWP(20 yr) = 97 and GWP(100 yr) = 27, respectively (by mass). Furthermore, stratospheric aerosol particles produced by the photolysis of COS (chemical feedback) contribute to a negative direct solar radiative forcing, which in the CCM amounts to −0.007 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere for the anthropogenic fraction, more than two times the direct warming forcing of COS. Considering that the lifetime of COS is twice that of stratospheric aerosols the warming and cooling tendencies approximately cancel.		1

Each instrument's water vapor profile measurements were compiled into monthly zonal mean time series on a common latitude-pressure grid. These time series serve as basis for the “climatological” validation approach used within the project. The evaluations include comparisons of monthly or annual zonal mean cross sections and seasonal cycles in the tropical and extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere averaged over one or more years, comparisons of interannual variability, and a study of the time evolution of physical features in water vapor such as the tropical tape recorder and polar vortex dehydration. Our knowledge of the atmospheric mean state in water vapor is best in the lower and middle stratosphere of the tropics and midlatitudes, with a relative uncertainty of ±2–6% (as quantified by the standard deviation of the instruments' multiannual means). The uncertainty increases toward the polar regions (±10–15%), the mesosphere (±15%), and the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere below 100 hPa (±30–50%), where sampling issues add uncertainty due to large gradients and high natural variability in water vapor. The minimum found in multiannual (1998–2008) mean water vapor in the tropical lower stratosphere is 3.5 ppmv (±14%), with slightly larger uncertainties for monthly mean values. The frequently used HALOE water vapor data set shows consistently lower values than most other data sets throughout the atmosphere, with increasing deviations from the multi-instrument mean below 100 hPa in both the tropics and extratropics. The knowledge gained from these comparisons and regarding the quality of the individual data sets in different regions of the atmosphere will help to improve model-measurement comparisons (e.g., for diagnostics such as the tropical tape recorder or seasonal cycles), data merging activities, and studies of climate variability.		1

OSIRIS is one of the very few current satellite instruments deriving ground state [NO] during the polar winter. The production of NO in this region is strongly dependent on energetic particle precipitation (EPP), and densities are therefore observed to vary with solar activity. Between 2003 and 2009, mean Antarctic winter [NO] in the mesosphere–lower thermosphere decreased by a factor of 3.7, and now, after the prolonged solar minimum that spanned 2008–2009, [NO] in this region is on the rise. As solar activity increases in the next few years, the production of NO is expected to increase. As downward advection readily transports NOx into the lower mesosphere and stratosphere, such an increase will lead to a greater potential for stratospheric ozone loss.		1

Even though most biomass burning smoke is typically confined to the boundary layer, some of these emissions are injected directly into the free troposphere via fire-related convective processes and transported away from the emission source. Further knowledge of the aging of biomass burning emissions in the free troposphere is needed. Tracer-tracer correlations are made between known pyrogenic species in these plumes in an effort to characterize them and follow their chemical evolution. Criteria such as age and type of biomass material burned are considered.		1

These gases are H2O, O3, N2O, CO, CH4, HNO3, HF, HCl, OCS, ClONO2, HCN, CH3Cl, CF4, CCl2F2, CCl3F, COF2, CHF2Cl, and SF6. Due to the complete lack of close spatiotemporal coincidences between the ACE occultations and the MkIV balloon flights, we used potential temperatures and equivalent latitudes from analyzed meteorological fields to find comparable ACE and MkIV profiles. The results show excellent agreement for CH4, N2O, and other long-lived gases but slightly poorer agreement for shorter-lived species like CO, O3, and HCN. For example, in the upper troposphere (∼400–650 K), maximum differences between MkIV and ACE are 2.4% for CH4, 1.7% for N2O, −12.4% for CO, −15.9% for O3, and −5.6% for HCN. In the lower stratosphere (∼650–900 K), maximum MkIV-ACE differences are 7.6% for CH4, 14.1% for N2O, 7.3% for CO, −9.2% for O3, and 31.5% for HCN. Apart from a small vertical misregistration problem, the overall agreement between MkIV and ACE is very good.		1

In the thermosphere, CO2 is the primary radiative cooling agent and fundamentally affects the energy balance and temperature of this high-altitude atmospheric layer1, 2. Anthropogenic CO2 increases are expected to propagate upward throughout the entire atmosphere, which should result in a cooler, more contracted thermosphere3, 4, 5. This contraction, in turn, will reduce atmospheric drag on satellites and may have adverse consequences for the orbital debris environment that is already unstable6, 7. However, observed thermospheric mass density trends derived from satellite orbits are generally stronger than model predictions8, 9, indicating that our quantitative understanding of these changes is incomplete. So far, CO2 trends have been measured only up to 35 km altitude10, 11, 12. Here, we present direct evidence that CO2 concentrations in the upper atmosphere—probably the primary driver of long-term thermospheric trends—are increasing. We analyse eight years of CO2 and carbon monoxide mixing ratios derived from satellite-based solar occultation spectra. After correcting for seasonal–latitudinal and solar influences, we obtain an estimated global increase in COx (CO2 and CO, combined) concentrations of 23.5±6.3 ppm per decade at an altitude of 101 km, about 10 ppm per decade faster than predicted by an upper atmospheric model. We suggest that this discrepancy may explain why the thermospheric density decrease is stronger than expected.		1

The comparison is performed for global zonal averages and heights from 10 to 50 km in one km steps. The validation was performed by comparing monthly mean zonal means and by comparing averages over collocated profiles within a zonal band and month. Both approaches yield similar results. For most of the stratosphere SCIAMACHY agrees to within 10% or better with other correlative data. A systematic bias of SCIAMACHY ozone of up to 100% between 10 and 20 km in the tropics points to some remaining issues with regard to convective cloud interference. Statistical hypothesis testing reveals at which altitudes and in which region differences between SCIAMACHY and other satellite data are statistically significant. We also estimated linear trends from monthly mean data for different periods where SCIAMACHY has common observations with other satellite data using a classical trend model with QBO and seasonal terms in order to draw conclusions on potential instrumental drifts as a function of latitude and altitude. Since the time periods considered here are rather short these trend estimates are only used to identify potential instrumental issues with the SCIAMACHY data. As a result SCIAMACHY exhibits a statistically significant negative trend in the range of of about 1–3% per year depending on latitude during the period 2002–2005 (overlapping with HALOE and SAGE II) and somewhat less during 2002–2008 (overlapping with SABER) in the altitude range of 30–40 km, while in the period 2004–2008 (overlapping with MLS and ACE-FTS) no significant trends are observed. Since all correlative satellite instruments do not show to a very large extent statistically significant trends in any of the time periods considered here, the negative trends observed with SCIAMACHY data point at some remaining instrumental artifact which is most likely related to residual errors in the tangent height registration of SCIAMACHY.		1

In winter 2011, the polar vortex was strong and cold for an unusually long time. Our research site, located at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada (80.05° N, 86.42° W), was mostly inside the vortex from October 2010 until late March 2011. The Bruker 125HR Fourier transform infrared spectrometer installed at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory at Eureka acquired measurements from 23 February to 6 April during the 2011 Canadian Arctic Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Validation Campaign. These measurements showed unusually low ozone, HCl, and HNO3 total columns compared to the previous 14 yr. To remove dynamical effects, we normalized these total columns by the HF total column. The normalized values of the ozone, HCl, and HNO3 total columns were smaller than those from previous years, and confirmed the occurrence of chlorine activation and chemical ozone depletion. To quantify the chemical ozone loss, a three-dimensional chemical transport model, SLIMCAT, and the passive subtraction method were used. The chemical ozone depletion was calculated as the mean percentage difference between the measured ozone and the SLIMCAT passive ozone, and was found to be 35%.		1

Spatial and temporal variability in these data suggest that convection plays a significant role in setting water vapor isotopic composition in these regions. In many instances, enhancements in HDO/H2O (i.e., δD) are closely tied to patterns of climatological deep convection and uncorrelated with water vapor, although convection appears to have different isotopic effects in different locations. The ACE-FTS data reveal seasonal variations in the tropics and allow mapping of climatological regional structure. These data reveal strong regional isotopic enhancement associated with the North American summer monsoon but not the Asian monsoon or the western Pacific warm pool. We suggest that the isotopic effects of deep convection near the tropopause are moderated by the ambient relative humidity, which controls the amount of convective ice that evaporates. Local convective signals can in turn affect global behavior: the North America monsoon influence introduces a Northern Hemisphere–Southern Hemisphere asymmetry in water isotopic composition in the lower stratosphere that extends into the tropics and influences the apparent seasonal cycle in averaged tropical UTLS data. Seasonal variation in tropical lower stratospheric water isotopic composition extends up to ∼20 km in ACE retrievals, but in contrast to previous reports, there is no clear evidence of propagation beyond the lowermost stratosphere. The reliability of these observations is supported by the broad consistency of ACE-FTS averaged tropical profiles with previous remote and in situ δD measurements.		1

The two eruptions with the greatest impact on the high-latitude upper troposphere during the time frame of this satellite-based remote sensing mission are chosen. The Puyehue–Cordón Caulle volcanic eruption in June 2011 was the most explosive in the past 24 years and is shown to be able to account for the observed (50 ± 12) % increase in water vapour in the southern high-latitude upper troposphere in July 2011 after a minor adjustment for the simultaneous influence of the Antarctic oscillation. Eyjafjallajökull erupted in the spring of 2010, increasing water vapour in the upper troposphere at northern high latitudes significantly for a period of  ∼  1 month. These findings imply that extratropical volcanic eruptions in windy environments can lead to significant perturbations to high-latitude upper tropospheric humidity mostly due to entrainment of lower tropospheric moisture by wind-blown plumes. The Puyehue–Cordón Caulle eruption must be taken into account to properly determine the magnitude of the trend in southern high-latitude upper tropospheric water vapour over the last decade.		1

Ground-based measurements of mesospheric CO made at the Onsala Space Observatory, OSO, (57° N, 12° E) are presented. The dataset covers the period 2002–2008 and is hence uniquely long for ground-based observations. The simple and stable 115 GHz frequency-switched radiometer, calibration method, retrieval procedure and error characterization are described. A comparison between our measurements and co-located CO measurements from the satellite sensors ACE-FTS on Scisat (v2.2), MLS on Aura (v3-3), MIPAS on Envisat (V3O_CO_12 + 13 and V4O_CO_200) and SMR on Odin (v225 and v021) is carried out. Our instrument, OSO, and the four satellite instruments show the same general variation of the vertical distribution of mesospheric CO in both the annual cycle and in shorter time period events, with high CO mixing ratios during winter and very low amounts during summer in the observed 55–100 km altitude range. During 2004–2008 the agreement of the OSO instrument and the satellite sensors ACE-FTS, MLS and MIPAS (200) is good in the altitude range 55–70 km. Above 70 km, OSO shows up to 25% higher CO column values compared to both ACE and MLS. For the time period 2002–2004, CO from MIPAS (12 + 13) is up to 50% lower than OSO between 55 and 70 km. Mesospheric CO from the two versions of SMR deviates up to ±65% when compared to OSO, but the analysis is based on only a few co-locations.		1

These variables are accurately derived from about 20 km (MA) and 40 km (UA and NLC) to 105 km globally and both at daytime and nighttime. Typical temperature random errors are smaller than 0.5 K below 50 km, 0.5–2 K at 50–70 km, and 2–7 K above. The systematic error is typically 1 K below 70 km, 1–3 K from 70 to 85 km and 3–11 K from 85 to 100 km. The average vertical resolution is typically 4 km below 35 km, 3 km at 35–50 km, 4–6 km at 50–90 km, and 6–10 km above. We compared our MIPAS temperature retrievals from 2005 to 2009 with co-located ground-based measurements from the lidars located at the Table Mountain Facility and Mauna Loa Observatory, the SATI spectrograph in Granada (Spain) and the Davis station spectrometer, and satellite observations from ACE-FTS, Aura-MLS and TIMED-SABER from 20 km to 100 km. We also compared MIPAS temperatures with the high latitudes climatology from falling sphere measurements. The comparisons show very good agreement, with differences smaller than 3 K below 85–90 km in mid-latitudes. Differences over the poles in this altitude range are larger but can be generally explained in terms of known biases of the other instruments. The comparisons above 90 km worsen and MIPAS retrieved temperatures are always larger than other instrument measurements.		1

We observed ClO diurnal variations using the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) on the International Space Station, which has a non-sun-synchronous orbit. This includes the first global observations of the ClO diurnal variation from the stratosphere up to the mesosphere. The observation of mesospheric ClO was possible due to 10–20 times better signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the spectra than those of past or ongoing microwave/submillimeter-wave limb-emission sounders. We performed a quantitative error analysis for the strato- and mesospheric ClO from the Level-2 research (L2r) product version 2.1.5 taking into account all possible contributions of errors, i.e. errors due to spectrum noise, smoothing, and uncertainties in radiative transfer model and instrument functions. The SMILES L2r v2.1.5 ClO data are useful over the range from 0.01 and 100 hPa with a total error estimate of 10–30 pptv (about 10%) with averaging 100 profiles. The SMILES ClO vertical resolution is 3–5 km and 5–8 km for the stratosphere and mesosphere, respectively. The SMILES observations reproduced the diurnal variation of stratospheric ClO, with peak values at midday, observed previously by the Microwave Limb Sounder on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS/MLS). Mesospheric ClO demonstrated an opposite diurnal behavior, with nighttime values being larger than daytime values. A ClO enhancement of about 100 pptv was observed at 0.02 to 0.01 hPa (about 70–80 km) for 50° N–65° N from January–February 2010. The performance of SMILES ClO observations opens up new opportunities to investigate ClO up to the mesopause.		1

For the first time, continuous temperature profiles extending from the stratopause to the upper mesosphere have been derived from OSIRIS measurements of Rayleigh-scattered sunlight. Through most of the mesosphere, OSIRIS temperatures are in good agreement with coincident temperature profiles derived from other satellite and ground-based measurements. In the altitude region of 55–80 km, OSIRIS temperatures are typically within 4–5 K of those from the SABER, ACE-FTS, and SOFIE instruments on the TIMED, SciSat-I, and AIM satellites, respectively. The mean differences between individual OSIRIS profiles and those of the other satellite instruments are typically within the combined uncertainties and previously reported biases. OSIRIS temperatures are typically within 2 K of those from the University of Western Ontario's Purple Crow Lidar in the altitude region of 52–79 km, where the mean differences are within combined uncertainties. Near 84 km, OSIRIS temperatures exhibit a cold bias of 10–15 K, which is due to a cold bias in OSIRIS O2 A-band temperatures at 85 km, the upper boundary of the Rayleigh-scatter derived temperatures; and near 48 km OSIRIS temperatures exhibit a cold bias of 5–15 K, which is likely due to multiple-scatter effects that are not taken into account in the retrieval.		1

For the MIPAS full-resolution period (2002–2004) these are V5H_CH4_21 and V5H_N2O_21 and for the reduced-resolution period (2005–2012) these are V5R_CH4_224, V5R_CH4_225, V5R_N2O_224 and V5R_N2O_225. Here, we compare CH4 profiles to those measured by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer on board of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE-FTS), the HALogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), to the Global Cooperative Air Sampling Network (GCASN) surface data. We find the MIPAS CH4 profiles below 25 km to be typically higher of the order of 0.1 ppmv for both measurement periods. N2O profiles are compared to those measured by ACE-FTS, the Microwave Limb Sounder on board of the Aura satellite (Aura-MLS) and the Sub-millimetre Radiometer on board of the Odin satellite (Odin-SMR) as well as to the Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species Group (HATS) surface data. The mixing ratios of the satellite instruments agree well with each other for the full-resolution period. For the reduced-resolution period, MIPAS produces similar values as Odin-SMR, but higher values than ACE-FTS and HATS. Below 27 km, the MIPAS profiles show higher mixing ratios than Aura-MLS, and lower values between 27 and 41 km. Cross-comparisons between the two MIPAS measurement periods show that they generally agree quite well, but, especially for CH4, the reduced-resolution period seems to produce slightly higher mixing ratios than the full-resolution data.		1

The data show that hydrogen peroxide exhibits both a seasonal and diurnal cycle with high variability in the upper troposphere. ACE data also show the influence of photochemistry on sunrise and sunset hydrogen peroxide distributions. The tropospheric hydrogen peroxide distribution was compared with output from the three-dimensional chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. The GEOS-Chem model is in good general agreement with ACE for hydrogen peroxide, capturing the main features observed including the diurnal and seasonal variation; however volume mixing ratios (VMRs) for the model are consistently greater than those of ACE.		1

Using a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), we find that these events result from deep convective processes that rapidly transport air with low ozone concentrations from the marine boundary layer. These events occur with greater frequency over the tropical South Pacific warm pool, which is consistent with ozonesonde observations. The satellite observations indicate spatial shifts in the frequency of low ozone events that we attribute to changes in convection. As the location of the warm pool shifts eastward during El Niño events, the location of the most frequent low ozone events in the satellite record follows. Mapping of low ozone events over time reveals eastward propagating systems resembling the Madden-Julian Oscillation. These observations and analyses strengthen the link between deep convection and ozone concentrations in the tropical upper troposphere.		1

It relies on accurate representation of the solar disk, including its limb darkening, and how its image is affected by atmospheric refraction. The Zernike polynomials are used to quantify the flattening in the Sun images. \r\n\r\nThe inversion algorithm relies on a transfer matrix providing the link between the atmospheric pressure profile and a sequence of Zernike moments computed on the sunset frames. The transfer matrix is determined by a training dataset of pressure profiles generated from a standard climatology. \r\n\r\nThe performance and limitations of the method are assessed by two test cases. Pressure profiles similar to the training dataset show that retrieval error can be up to 10 times smaller than the natural variability in the lower mesosphere, and up to 500 times smaller in the upper troposphere. Tests with other independent profiles emphasize the need for better representativeness of the training dataset.		1

We present validation studies of the SMILES version 2.1 ozone product based on coincidence statistics with satellite observations and outputs of chemistry and transport models (CTMs). Comparisons of the stratospheric ozone with correlative data show agreements that are generally within 10%. In the mesosphere, the agreement is also good and better than 30% even at a high altitude of 73 km, and the SMILES measurements with their local time coverage also capture the diurnal variability very well. The recommended altitude range for scientific use is from 16 to 73 km. We note that the SMILES ozone values for altitude above 26 km are smaller than some of the correlative satellite datasets; conversely the SMILES values in the lower stratosphere tend to be larger than correlative data, particularly in the tropics, with less than 8% difference below ~24 km. The larger values in the lower stratosphere are probably due to departure of retrieval results between two detection bands at altitudes below 28 km; it is ~3% at 24 km and is increasing rapidly down below.		1

Seasonal variations in both species densities and airglow emissions are well documented. The extensive observations available offer an excellent case study for comparison with model simulations. A broad range of MSAO measurements is summarised with emphasis on the 80–100 km region. The objective here is not to address directly the complicated driving forces of the MSAO, but rather to employ a combination of observations and model simulations to estimate the limits of some of the underlying dynamical processes. Photochemical model simulations are included for near-equinox and near-solstice conditions, the two times with notable differences in the observed MSAO parameters. Diurnal tides are incorporated in the model to facilitate comparisons of observations made at different local times. The roles of water vapour as the "driver" species and ozone as the "response" species are examined to test for consistency between the model results and observations. The simulations suggest the interactions between vertical eddy diffusion and background vertical advection play a significant role in the MSAO phenomenon. Further, the simulations imply there are rigid limits on vertical advection rates and eddy diffusion rates. For August at the Equator, 90 km altitude, the derived eddy diffusion rate is approximately 1 × 106 cm2 s−1 and the vertical advection is upwards at 0.8 cm s−1. For April the corresponding values are 4 × 105 cm2 s−1 and 0.1 cm s−1. These results from the current 1-D model simulations will need to be verified by a full 3-D simulation. Exactly how vertical advection and eddy diffusion are related to gravity wave momentum as discussed by Dunkerton (1982) three decades ago remains to be addressed.		1

Over the past decade, the SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY) instrument on ENVISAT (European Environmental Satellite) has been providing global coverage of stratospheric NO2 every 6 days. In this study, the vertical distributions of NO2 retrieved from SCIAMACHY limb measurements of the scattered solar light are validated by comparison with NO2 products from three different satellite instruments (SAGE II, HALOE and ACE-FTS). The retrieval algorithm based on the information operator approach is discussed, and the sensitivity of the SCIAMACHY NO2 limb retrievals is investigated. The photochemical corrections needed to make this validation feasible, and the chosen collocation criteria are described. For each instrument, a time period of two years is analyzed with several hundreds of collocation pairs for each year. As NO2 is highly variable, the comparisons are performed for five latitudinal bins and four seasons. In the 20 to 40 km altitude range, mean relative differences between SCIAMACHY and other instruments are found to be typically within 20 to 30%. The mean partial NO2 columns in this altitude range agree typically within 15% (both global monthly and zonal annual means). Larger differences are seen for SAGE II comparisons, which is consistent with the results presented by other authors. For SAGE II and ACE-FTS, the observed differences can be partially attributed to the diurnal effect error.		1

In this study, we present the first long-term time series of methanol total, lower tropospheric and upper tropospheric–lower stratospheric partial columns derived from the analysis of high resolution Fourier transform infrared solar spectra recorded at the Jungfraujoch station (46.5° N, 3580 m a.s.l.). The retrieval of methanol is very challenging due to strong absorptions of ozone in the region of the selected υ8 band of CH3OH. Two wide spectral intervals have been defined and adjusted in order to maximise the information content. Methanol does not exhibit a significant trend over the 1995–2012 time period, but a strong seasonal modulation characterised by maximum values and variability in June–July, minimum columns in winter and a peak-to-peak amplitude of 130%. Analysis and comparisons with in situ measurements carried out at the Jungfraujoch and ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier transform spectrometer) occultations have been performed. The total and lower tropospheric columns are also compared with IMAGESv2 model simulations. There is no systematic bias between the observations and IMAGESv2 but the model underestimates the peak-to-peak amplitude of the seasonal modulations.		1

However, there is a factor of 3–4 discrepancy between the laboratory measurements of the CO2-O quenching rate coefficient, kVT, and its value estimated from the atmospheric observations. In this study, we retrieve kVT in the altitude region 85–105 km from the coincident SABER/TIMED and Fort Collins sodium lidar observations by minimizing the difference between measured and simulated broadband limb 15 μm radiation. The averaged kVT value obtained in this work is 6.5 ± 1.5 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 that is close to other estimates of this coefficient from the atmospheric observations. However, the retrieved kVT also shows altitude dependence and varies from 5.5 ± 1.1 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 at 90 km to 7.9 ± 1.2 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 at 105 km. Obtained results demonstrate the deficiency in current non-LTE modeling of the atmospheric 15 μm radiation, based on the application of the CO2-O quenching and excitation rates, which are linked by the detailed balance relation. We discuss the possible model improvements, among them accounting for the interaction of the "non-thermal" oxygen atoms with CO2 molecules.		1

The new 4 K superconducting heterodyne receiver technology of SMILES allowed us to obtain a one order of magnitude better signal-to-noise ratio for the O3 line observation compared to past spaceborne microwave instruments. The non-sun-synchronous orbit of the ISS allowed us to observe O3 at various local times. We assessed the quality of the vertical profiles of O3 in the 100–0.001 hPa (~ 16–90 km) region for the SMILES NICT Level 2 product version 2.1.5. The evaluation is based on four components: error analysis; internal comparisons of observations targeting three different instrumental setups for the same O3 625.371 GHz transition; internal comparisons of two different retrieval algorithms; and external comparisons for various local times with ozonesonde, satellite and balloon observations (ENVISAT/MIPAS, SCISAT/ACE-FTS, Odin/OSIRIS, Odin/SMR, Aura/MLS, TELIS). SMILES O3 data have an estimated absolute accuracy of better than 0.3 ppmv (3%) with a vertical resolution of 3–4 km over the 60 to 8 hPa range. The random error for a single measurement is better than the estimated systematic error, being less than 1, 2, and 7%, in the 40–1, 80–0.1, and 100–0.004 hPa pressure regions, respectively. SMILES O3 abundance was 10–20% lower than all other satellite measurements at 8–0.1 hPa due to an error arising from uncertainties of the tangent point information and the gain calibration for the intensity of the spectrum. SMILES O3 from observation frequency Band-B had better accuracy than that from Band-A. A two month period is required to accumulate measurements covering 24 h in local time of O3 profile. However such a dataset can also contain variation due to dynamical, seasonal, and latitudinal effects.		1

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) datasets are from the Cryogen Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES), the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere (CRISTA-1 and CRISTA-2), the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE). Stratospheric loss rates were calculated using an ultraviolet radiative transfer code with updated cross section and solar irradiance data. Mean steady-state lifetimes based on these observations are 44.7 (36–58) yr for CFC-11 and 106.6 (90–130) yr for CFC-12, which are in good agreement with the most recent WMO ozone assessment. There are two major sources of error in calculating lifetimes using this method. The first important error arises from uncertainties in tropical stratospheric observations, particularly for CFC-11. Another large contribution to the error is due to uncertainties in the penetration of solar ultraviolet radiation at wavelengths between 185 and 220 nm, primarily in the tropical stratosphere between 20 and 35 km altitude.		1

We show that this extended altitude range has been acquired without disturbing the existing long-term WVMS data set at Mauna Loa. Validation of the successful transition is provided by comparing WVMS measurements with coincident satellite measurements from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment, and the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding. At the lowest altitudes where WVMS measurements are possible, we also compare with frost-point hygrometer balloon measurements. The water vapor mixing ratios measured at 50 km over Mauna Loa are the highest ever reported in the WVMS (since 1996) or MLS (since 2004) time series. Particularly encouraging for the new 26 km WVMS measurements is that they indicate an increase between 2010 and 2011 that is comparable to that observed by other instruments. This shows that these measurements are sensitive to variations at this altitude and that the instrumental baseline remains stable.		1

The lidar is capable of measuring water vapour in the dry Arctic atmosphere up to the tropopause region. Measurements were obtained in the February to March polar sunrise during 2007, 2008 and 2009 as part of the Canadian Arctic ACE (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment) Validation Campaign. Before such measurements can be used to address important questions in understanding dynamics and chemistry, the lidar measurements must be calibrated against an independent determination of water vapour. Here, radiosonde measurements of relative humidity have been used to empirically calibrate the lidar measurements. It was found that the calibration varied significantly between each year's campaign. However, the calibration of the lidar during an individual polar sunrise campaign agrees on average with the local radiosonde measurements to better than 12%. To independently validate the calibration of the lidar derived from the radiosondes, comparisons are made between the calibrated lidar measurements and water vapour measurements from the ACE satellite-borne Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). The comparisons between the lidar and satellite-borne spectrometer for both a campaign average and single overpasses show favourable agreement between the two instruments and help validate the lidar's calibration. The 39 nights of high-Arctic water vapour measurements obtained offer the most detailed high spatial-temporal resolution measurement set available for understanding this time of transition from the long polar night to polar day.		1

The method uses stratospheric N2O columns to correct for the stratospheric contribution to the CH4 total column. The method was applied to four Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites covering locations from the Northern Arctic to the tropics. It performs well for all sites. The derived tropospheric CH4 concentrations were compared with profiles measured by aircraft at three sites. The results indicate an inter-site consistency within 6 ppb (~0.3%). With aircraft profiles up to 3 km, the seasonal behavior of the derived tropospheric CH4 concentration was also checked, revealing a difference of around 20 ppb. The mean relative uncertainty of the four sites, as estimated from the daily standard deviations, is 0.23%.		1

The central focus of the experiment was a two-week deployment of the UK BAe-146-301 Atmospheric Research Aircraft (ARA) over eastern Canada, based out of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Atmospheric ground-based and sonde measurements over Canada and the Azores associated with the planned July 2010 deployment of the ARA, which was postponed by 12 months due to UK-based flights related to the dispersal of material emitted by the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, went ahead and constituted phase A of the experiment. Phase B of BORTAS in July 2011 involved the same atmospheric measurements, but included the ARA, special satellite observations and a more comprehensive ground-based measurement suite. The high-frequency aircraft data provided a comprehensive chemical snapshot of pyrogenic plumes from wildfires, corresponding to photochemical (and physical) ages ranging from < 1 day to ~<45 sr 10 days, largely by virtue of widespread fires over Northwestern Ontario. Airborne measurements reported a large number of emitted gases including semi-volatile species, some of which have not been been previously reported in pyrogenic plumes, with the corresponding emission ratios agreeing with previous work for common gases. Analysis of the NOy data shows evidence of net ozone production in pyrogenic plumes, controlled by aerosol abundance, which increases as a function of photochemical age. The coordinated ground-based and sonde data provided detailed but spatially limited information that put the aircraft data into context of the longer burning season in the boundary layer. Ground-based measurements of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) over Halifax show that forest fires can on an episodic basis represent a substantial contribution to total surface PM2.5.		1

We also show CH4 measurements from the MIPAS and ACE instruments and use these to help interpret the H2O variations. We find that interannual changes in stratospheric H2O of ~0.5 ppmv, observed from Table Mountain, California, at 26 km and 40 km from 2010 to 2012, are caused primarily by dynamically driven changes in CH4 during this period. The interannual variations in H2O observed over Mauna Loa, Hawaii, are shown to be quite similar to the average variations observed over 50°S–50°N in the lower mesosphere; thus, we conclude that a single ground-based microwave instrument can provide a useful estimate of interannual globally averaged lower mesospheric H2O variations, even when such changes are as small as ~0.2–0.3 ppmv. We find that the increase of ~0.2–0.3 ppmv in H2O in the lower mesosphere since 2006 is qualitatively consistent with an increase in tropical tropopause temperature since around 2001.		1

We focus on quantifying large-scale seasonal behavior from the middle troposphere to the stratosphere, particularly in the tropics, and furthermore make detailed comparisons with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) chemistry climate model (incorporating tropospheric photochemistry, time-varying hydrocarbon emissions, and meteorological fields nudged from reanalysis). Comparisons with Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements of CO are also included to understand sampling limitations of the ACE-FTS data and biases among observational data sets. Results show similar overall variability for CO, C2H6, and C2H2, with a semiannual cycle in the tropical upper troposphere related to seasonallyvarying sources and deep tropical convection, plus a maximum during Northern Hemisphere summer tied to the Asian monsoon anticyclone. These species also reveal a strong annual cycle above the tropical tropopause, tied to annual variations in the upward branch of Brewer-Dobson circulation. HCN reveals substantial differences from the other species, due to a longer photochemical lifetime and a chemical sink associated with ocean surface contact, which produces a minimum in the tropical upper troposphere not observed in the other species. For HCN, transport to the stratosphere occurs primarily through the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone. Overall, the WACCM simulation is able to reproduce most of the large-scale features observed in the ACE-FTS data, suggesting a reasonable simulation of sources and large-scale transport. The model is too low in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics during Austral spring, which indicates underestimate of biomass burning emissions and/or insufficient vertical transport in the model.		1

Its importance in stratospheric ozone chemistry is expected to increase in the coming decades as emission controls alter the relative contributions from natural and anthropogenic halogen sources. The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on NASA's Aura satellite provides the first daily global observations of CH3Cl. Here we quantify the quality of the MLS version 3 CH3Cl data (single-profile precision of ±100 pptv; accuracy of 30–45%; vertical and horizontal resolution of 4–5 km and 450–600 km, respectively) and demonstrate their utility for scientific studies over the vertical range from 147 to 4.6 hPa. We exploit the unmatched scope of the 8 year MLS data set to investigate the spatial, seasonal, and interannual variations in the distribution of CH3Cl in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS). Like carbon monoxide, CH3Cl is a marker of pollution from biomass burning that can be lofted to the UTLS very rapidly by deep convection. The climatological seasonal cycle in CH3Cl reflects variability in regional fire activity and other surface sources as well as convection, and anomalous CH3Cl enhancements in the tropical upper troposphere are linked to specific episodes of intense burning. Methyl chloride is shown to be very useful as a tracer of large-scale dynamical processes, such as diabatic descent inside the stratospheric winter polar vortices, quasi-isentropic cross-tropopause transport associated with the summer monsoon circulations, and effects related to the quasi-biennial oscillation and the tropical “tape recorder”.		1

The simultaneous aerial, ground and satellite measurement campaign sought to record instances of boreal biomass burning to measure the tropospheric volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of short- and long-lived trace molecular species from biomass burning emissions. The goal was to investigate the connection between the composition and the distribution of these pyrogenic outflows and their resulting perturbation to atmospheric chemistry, with particular focus on oxidant species to determine the overall impact on the oxidizing capacity of the free troposphere. \r\n\r\nMeasurements of pyrogenic trace species in boreal biomass burning plumes were made by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) onboard the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) SCISAT-1 satellite during the BORTAS campaign. Even though biomass burning emissions are typically confined to the boundary layer, outflows are often injected into the upper troposphere by isolated convection and fire-related convective processes, thus allowing space-borne instruments to measure these pyrogenic outflows. An extensive set of 14 molecules – CH3OH, C2H2, C2H6, C3H6O, CO, HCN, HCOOH, HNO3, H2CO, NO, NO2, OCS, O3, and PAN – have been analysed. Included in this analysis is the calculation of age-dependent sets of enhancement ratios for each of the species originating from fires in North America (Canada, Alaska) and Siberia for a period of up to 7 days. Ratio values for the shorter lived primary pyrogenic species decrease over time primarily due to oxidation by the OH radical as the plume ages and values for longer lived species such as HCN and C2H6 remain relatively unchanged. Increasing negative values are observed for the oxidant species, including O3, indicating a destruction process in the plume as it ages such that concentrations of the oxidant species have dropped below their off-plume values. \r\n\r\nResults from previous campaigns have indicated that values for the molar ratios of ΔO3 /ΔO obtained from the measurements of the pyrogenic outflow from boreal fires are highly variable and range from negative to positive, irrespective of plume age. This variability has been attributed to pollution effects where the pyrogenic outflows have mixed with either local urban NOx emissions or pyrogenic emissions from the long-range transport of older plumes, thus affecting the production of O3 within the plumes. The results from this study have identified another potential cause of the variability in O3 concentrations observed in the measurements of biomass burning emissions, where evidence of stratosphere–troposphere exchange due to the pyroconvective updrafts from fires has been identified. Perturbations caused by the lofted emissions in these fire-aided convective processes may result in the intrusion of stratospheric air masses into the free troposphere and subsequent mixing of stratospheric O3 into the pyrogenic outflows causing fluctuations in observed ΔO3/ΔCO molar ratios.		1

Despite significant differences between data sets, we identify some observed HDO/H2O characteristics that are robust across data sets and that can be used to evaluate models. We evaluate the isotopic GCM LMDZ, accounting for the effects of spatiotemporal sampling and instrument sensitivity. We find that LMDZ reproduces the spatial patterns in the lower and mid troposphere remarkably well. However, it underestimates the amplitude of seasonal variations in isotopic composition at all levels in the subtropics and in midlatitudes, and this bias is consistent across all data sets. LMDZ also underestimates the observed meridional isotopic gradient and the contrast between dry and convective tropical regions compared to satellite data sets. Comparison with six other isotope-enabled GCMs from the SWING2 project shows that biases exhibited by LMDZ are common to all models. The SWING2 GCMs show a very large spread in isotopic behavior that is not obviously related to that of humidity, suggesting water vapor isotopic measurements could be used to expose model shortcomings. In a companion paper, the isotopic differences between models are interpreted in terms of biases in the representation of processes controlling humidity.		1

Model simulations were conducted using twelve models and four model variants and results were archived for the period of 1990–2007. All but one model transports were driven by reanalysis products from 3 different meteorological agencies. The transport and removal of CH4 in six different emission scenarios were simulated, with net global emissions of 513 ± 9 and 514 ± 14 Tg CH4 yr−1 for the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Additionally, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was simulated to check the interhemispheric transport, radon (222Rn) to check the subgrid scale transport, and methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) to check the chemical removal by the tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH). The results are compared to monthly or annual mean time series of CH4, SF6 and CH3CCl3 measurements from 8 selected background sites, and to satellite observations of CH4 in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. Most models adequately capture the vertical gradients in the stratosphere, the average long-term trends, seasonal cycles, interannual variations (IAVs) and interhemispheric (IH) gradients at the surface sites for SF6, CH3CCl3 and CH4. The vertical gradients of all tracers between the surface and the upper troposphere are consistent within the models, revealing vertical transport differences between models. An average IH exchange time of 1.39 ± 0.18 yr is derived from SF6 time series. Sensitivity simulations suggest that the estimated trends in exchange time, over the period of 1996–2007, are caused by a change of SF6 emissions towards the tropics. Using six sets of emission scenarios, we show that the decadal average CH4 growth rate likely reached equilibrium in the early 2000s due to the flattening of anthropogenic emission growth since the late 1990s. Up to 60% of the IAVs in the observed CH4 concentrations can be explained by accounting for the IAVs in emissions, from biomass burning and wetlands, as well as meteorology in the forward models. The modeled CH4 budget is shown to depend strongly on the troposphere-stratosphere exchange rate and thus on the model's vertical grid structure and circulation in the lower stratosphere. The 15-model median CH4 and CH3CCl3 atmospheric lifetimes are estimated to be 9.99 ± 0.08 and 4.61 ± 0.13 yr, respectively, with little IAV due to transport and temperature.		1

Process-oriented diagnostics are used to validate dynamical and transport characteristics of 18 CCMs using meteorological analyses and aircraft and satellite observations. The main dynamical and chemical climatological characteristics of the extratropical UTLS are generally well represented by the models, despite the limited horizontal and vertical resolution. The seasonal cycle of lowermost stratospheric mass is realistic, however with a wide spread in its mean value. A tropopause inversion layer is present in most models, although the maximum in static stability is located too high above the tropopause and is somewhat too weak, as expected from limited model resolution. Similar comments apply to the extratropical tropopause transition layer. The seasonality in lower stratospheric chemical tracers is consistent with the seasonality in the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Both vertical and meridional tracer gradients are of similar strength to those found in observations. Models that perform less well tend to use a semi-Lagrangian transport scheme and/or have a very low resolution. Two models, and the multimodel mean, score consistently well on all diagnostics, while seven other models score well on all diagnostics except the seasonal cycle of water vapor. Only four of the models are consistently below average. The lack of tropospheric chemistry in most models limits their evaluation in the upper troposphere. Finally, the UTLS is relatively sparsely sampled by observations, limiting our ability to quantitatively evaluate many aspects of model performance.		1

Three winters (January–March) are considered: (1) 2005 (SPE), (2) 2009 (SSW), and (3) 2012 (SPEs and SSW). These different cases provide a good opportunity to study the roles that transport from the mesosphere-lower thermosphere region and in situ production due to particle precipitation have on stratospheric NOx levels and the consequent effects on the middle atmospheric ozone. The observations show increases in NOx after both the SPEs (days to weeks) and SSWs (weeks to months) by up to a factor of 25 between 40 and 90 km. The largest mesospheric NOx increases are observed following the SSW in late January 2009, but the most substantial effects in the upper stratosphere are seen when both an SSW and in situ production by SPEs take place (2012), even though the in situ NOx production in 2012 was relatively weak in magnitude compared to periods of much higher solar activity. In 2012, both short-term (days, due to SPEs and odd hydrogen) depletion and longer-term (months, due to several drivers) depletion of ozone of up to 90% are observed in the mesosphere and upper stratosphere, coinciding with the enhanced amounts of NOx.		1

In this work, the OSIRIS data are compared with a similar data set from the Sub-Millimeter Radiometer (SMR), also on the Odin satellite. Both of the Odin data sets are compared with twilight [NO] from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on the SciSat-I satellite. Direct comparisons of OSIRIS and SMR profiles show large differences, indicating that the individual [NO] profiles of one or both data sets may not be valid. However, when comparing averaged [NO], variations on timescales of weeks-years in all three data sets are in good agreement and correspond to the 27 day and 11 year solar cycles. The averaged OSIRIS values are typically 10% greater than SMR and 30% greater than ACE-FTS, which are within the estimated OSIRIS systematic uncertainties. These results suggest that the satellite-derived data sets can be used for determining polar-mean NO climatology and variations on timescales of weeks-years. The OSIRIS and SMR nighttime data sets show that the [NO] peak height in the MLT decreases throughout the autumn, from an altitude near or above 100 km to a minimum altitude ranging from 90 to 95 km around winter solstice. A similar decrease in [NO] peak height is observed in modeled NO climatology from the Specified Dynamics–Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM), although the SD-WACCM climatology exhibits a decrease throughout autumn from 107 km down to 102 km. The results suggest that global climate models require more sophisticated auroral forcing simulations in order to reproduce observed NO variations in this region.		1

Ozone from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument is used as the basis of comparison. Other measurements are from the Halogen Occultation Experiment, the High Resolution Doppler Imager, the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding, the Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars, the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment—Fourier Transform Spectrometer, the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment, the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System, and the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder. Comparisons of each data set with SABER using coincident profiles indicate agreement in the basic vertical profile of ozone but also some systematic differences in daytime ozone. Ozone from the SABER 9.6 μm channel is higher than the other measurements over the altitude range 60–80 km by 20–50%. Nighttime comparisons indicate better relative agreement (<10% difference). Taking all the data, not limited to coincidences, shows the global and seasonal distributions of ozone in the upper mesosphere from each instrument. The average maximum in ozone mixing ratio is around 90–92 km during daytime and 95 km at night. There is a maximum in ozone density at night (∼90 km) and during some hours of the day. The latitude structure of ozone has appreciable variations with season, particularly in the tropical upper mesosphere. The basic latitude-altitude structure of ozone depends on local time, even when the analysis is restricted to day-only observations.		1

These measurements provide high-vertical-resolution ozone profiles covering the altitude range from the upper troposphere up to the mesosphere in years 2001–2012. HARMOZ has been created in the framework of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative project. \r\n\r\nThe harmonized dataset consists of original retrieved ozone profiles from each instrument, which are screened for invalid data by the instrument teams. While the original ozone profiles are presented in different units and on different vertical grids, the harmonized dataset is given on a common pressure grid in netCDF (network common data form)-4 format. The pressure grid corresponds to vertical sampling of ~ 1 km below 20 km and 2–3 km above 20 km. The vertical range of the ozone profiles is specific for each instrument, thus all information contained in the original data is preserved. Provided altitude and temperature profiles allow the representation of ozone profiles in number density or mixing ratio on a pressure or altitude vertical grid. Geolocation, uncertainty estimates and vertical resolution are provided for each profile. For each instrument, optional parameters, which are related to the data quality, are also included. \r\n\r\nFor convenience of users, tables of biases between each pair of instruments for each month, as well as bias uncertainties, are provided. These tables characterize the data consistency and can be used in various bias and drift analyses, which are needed, for instance, for combining several datasets to obtain a long-term climate dataset. \r\n\r\nThis user-friendly dataset can be interesting and useful for various analyses and applications, such as data merging, data validation, assimilation and scientific research.		1

Level-1b data versions MIPAS/5.02 to MIPAS/5.06 were converted into volume mixing ratio profiles using the level-2 processor developed at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK) and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA). Consideration of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) as an interfering species, which is jointly retrieved, and CO2 line mixing is crucial for reliable retrievals. Parts of the CO2 Q-branch region that overlap with the CCl4 signature were omitted, since large residuals were still found even though line mixing was considered in the forward model. However, the omitted spectral region could be narrowed noticeably when line mixing was accounted for. A new CCl4 spectroscopic data set leads to slightly smaller CCl4 volume mixing ratios. In general, latitude–altitude cross sections show the expected CCl4 features with highest values of around 90 pptv at altitudes at and below the tropical tropopause and values decreasing with altitude and latitude due to stratospheric decomposition. Other patterns, such as subsidence in the polar vortex during winter and early spring, are also visible in the distributions. The decline in CCl4 abundance during the MIPAS Envisat measurement period (July 2002 to April 2012) is clearly reflected in the altitude–latitude cross section of trends estimated from the entire retrieved data set.		1

GROMOS is part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). In July 2009, a Fast-Fourier-Transform spectrometer (FFTS) has been added as backend to GROMOS. The new FFTS and the original filter bench (FB) measured parallel for over two years. In October 2011, the FB has been turned off and the FFTS is now used to continue the ozone time series. For a consolidated ozone time series in the frame of NDACC, the quality of the stratospheric ozone profiles obtained with the FFTS has to be assessed. The FFTS results from July 2009 to December 2011 are compared to ozone profiles retrieved by the FB. FFTS and FB of the GROMOS microwave radiometer agree within 5% above 20 hPa. A later harmonization of both time series will be realized by taking the FFTS as benchmark for the FB. Ozone profiles from the FFTS are also compared to coinciding lidar measurements from the Observatoire Haute Provence (OHP), France. For the time period studied a maximum mean difference (lidar – GROMOS FFTS) of +3.8% at 3.1 hPa and a minimum mean difference of +1.4% at 8 hPa is found. Further, intercomparisons with ozone profiles from other independent instruments are performed: satellite measurements include MIPAS onboard ENVISAT, SABER onboard TIMED, MLS onboard EOS Aura and ACE-FTS onboard SCISAT-1. Additionally, ozonesondes launched from Payerne, Switzerland, are used in the lower stratosphere. Mean relative differences of GROMOS FFTS and these independent instruments are less than 10% between 50 and 0.1 hPa.		1

The SMILES HCl value reveals 2.8–3.1 ppbv between 450 K and 500 K levels in potential temperature (PT). The high value of HCl is highlighted since it is suggested that HCl is a main component of the total inorganic chlorine (Cly), defined as Cly ≃ HCl + ClO + chlorine nitrate (ClONO2), inside the Antarctic vortex in spring, owing to low ozone values. To confirm the quality of two SMILES level 2 (L2) data products provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Japan's National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), vis-à-vis the partitioning of Cly, comparisons are made using other satellite data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). HCl values from the SMILES NICT L2 product agree to within 10% (0.3 ppbv) with the MLS HCl data between 450 and 575 K levels in PT and with the ACE-FTS HCl data between 425 and 575 K. The SMILES JAXA L2 product is 10 to 20% (0.2–0.5 ppbv) lower than that from MLS between 400 and 700 K and from ACE-FTS between 500 and 700 K. For ClO in daytime, the difference between SMILES (JAXA and NICT) and MLS is less than ±0.05 ppbv (100 %) between 500 K and 650 K with the ClO values less than 0.2 ppbv. ClONO2 values as measured by ACE-FTS also reveal 0.2 ppbv at 475–500 K level, resulting in the HCl / Cly ratios of 0.91–0.95. The HCl / Cly ratios derived from each retrieval agree to within −5 to 8 % with regard to their averages. The high HCl values and HCl / Cly ratios observed by the three instruments in the lower stratospheric Antarctic vortex are consistent with previous observations in late Austral spring.		1

The ozone climatologies in form of monthly zonal mean time series covering the upper troposphere to lower mesosphere are obtained from LIMS, SAGE I/II/III, UARS-MLS, HALOE, POAM II/III, SMR, OSIRIS, MIPAS, GOMOS, SCIAMACHY, ACE-FTS, ACE-MAESTRO, Aura-MLS, HIRDLS, and SMILES within 1978–2010. The intercomparisons focus on mean biases of annual zonal mean fields, interannual variability, and seasonal cycles. Additionally, the physical consistency of the data is tested through diagnostics of the quasi-biennial oscillation and Antarctic ozone hole. The comprehensive evaluations reveal that the uncertainty in our knowledge of the atmospheric ozone mean state is smallest in the tropical and midlatitude middle stratosphere with a 1σ multi-instrument spread of less than ±5%. While the overall agreement among the climatological data sets is very good for large parts of the stratosphere, individual discrepancies have been identified, including unrealistic month-to-month fluctuations, large biases in particular atmospheric regions, or inconsistencies in the seasonal cycle. Notable differences between the data sets exist in the tropical lower stratosphere (with a spread of ±30%) and at high latitudes (±15%). In particular, large relative differences are identified in the Antarctic during the time of the ozone hole, with a spread between the monthly zonal mean fields of ±50%. The evaluations provide guidance on what data sets are the most reliable for applications such as studies of ozone variability, model-measurement comparisons, detection of long-term trends, and data-merging activities.		1

Toohey and T. von Clarmann	2013	4	Atmospheric Measurement Techniques				6	4	937-948			https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/6/937/2013/		publications/pdfs/amt-6-937-2013.pdf			10.5194/amt-6-937-2013	f	Climatologies of atmospheric observations are often produced by binning measurements according to latitude and calculating zonal means. The uncertainty in these climatological means is characterised by the standard error of the mean (SEM). However, the usual estimator of the SEM, i.e., the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, holds only for uncorrelated randomly sampled measurements. Measurements of the atmospheric state along a satellite orbit cannot always be considered as independent because (a) the time-space interval between two nearest observations is often smaller than the typical scale of variations in the atmospheric state, and (b) the regular time-space sampling pattern of a satellite instrument strongly deviates from random sampling. We have developed a numerical experiment where global chemical fields from a chemistry climate model are sampled according to real sampling patterns of satellite-borne instruments. As case studies, the model fields are sampled using sampling patterns of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) satellite instruments. Through an iterative subsampling technique, and by incorporating information on the random errors of the MIPAS and ACE-FTS measurements, we produce empirical estimates of the standard error of monthly mean zonal mean model O3 in 5° latitude bins. We find that generally the classic SEM estimator is a conservative estimate of the SEM, i.e., the empirical SEM is often less than or approximately equal to the classic estimate. Exceptions occur only when natural variability is larger than the random measurement error, and specifically in instances where the zonal sampling distribution shows non-uniformity with a similar zonal structure as variations in the sampled field, leading to maximum sensitivity to arbitrary phase shifts between the sample distribution and sampled field. The occurrence of such instances is thus very sensitive to slight changes in the sampling distribution, and to the variations in the measured field. This study highlights the need for caution in the interpretation of the oft-used classically computed SEM, and outlines a relatively simple methodology that can be used to assess one component of the uncertainty in monthly mean zonal mean climatologies produced from measurements from satellite-borne instruments.		1

Precision estimates for SOFIE v1.022 H2O are ∼0.2%–2.5% up to 80 km and degrade to ∼20% at ∼90 km. The SOFIE total systematic error from the retrieval analysis remains at ∼3%–4% throughout the lower to middle mesosphere and increases from ∼9% at 85 km to ∼16% at 95 km. Comparisons with Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) H2O show excellent agreement (0%–2%) up to 80 km in the Northern Hemisphere with rare exceptions. Percentage differences above ∼85 km increase to ∼20% or worse due largely to the low H2O volume mixing ratios in the upper mesosphere. For the Southern Hemisphere SOFIE is consistently biased low by 10%–20% relative to both ACE-FTS and MLS H2O. Slopes of SOFIE daily mean H2O isopleths on an altitude versus time cross section are used as an indicator of upwelling air motion. In the lower to middle mesosphere, the slope is the largest from mid-May to mid-June (maximum of ∼1.5 cm/s), and then in July and August, it is reduced significantly. Both SOFIE and MLS daily mean H2O volume mixing ratios at the polar mesospheric cloud height increase rapidly from ∼2.0 to ∼5.0 ppmv prior to the solstice and then approach a near-constant but slightly increasing level (6.0–6.5 ppmv) throughout the season.		1

Retrieved volume mixing ratio profiles representing single measurements are characterized by typical errors in the range of 70–100 pptv and by a vertical resolution ranging from 3 to 5 km. Comparison with observations by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) revealed a slightly varying bias with altitude of −20 to 50 pptv for the MIPAS data set in case of volcanically enhanced concentrations. For background concentrations the comparison showed a systematic difference between the two major MIPAS observation periods. After debiasing, the difference could be reduced to biases within −10 to 20 pptv in the altitude range of 10–20 km with respect to ACE-FTS. Further comparisons of the debiased MIPAS data set with in situ measurements from various aircraft campaigns showed no obvious inconsistencies within a range of around ±50 pptv. The SO2 emissions of more than 30 volcanic eruptions could be identified in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Emitted SO2 masses and lifetimes within different altitude ranges in the UTLS have been derived for a large part of these eruptions. Masses are in most cases within estimations derived from other instruments. From three of the major eruptions within the MIPAS measurement period – Kasatochi in August 2008, Sarychev in June 2009 and Nabro in June 2011 – derived lifetimes of SO2 for the altitude ranges 10–14, 14–18 and 18–22 km are 13.3 ± 2.1, 23.6 ± 1.2 and 32.3 ± 5.5 days respectively. By omitting periods with obvious volcanic influence we have derived background mixing ratio distributions of SO2. At 10 km altitude these indicate an annual cycle at northern mid- and high latitudes with maximum values in summer and an amplitude of about 30 pptv. At higher altitudes of about 16–18 km, enhanced mixing ratios of SO2 can be found in the regions of the Asian and the North American monsoons in summer – a possible connection to an aerosol layer discovered by Vernier et al. (2011b) in that region.		1

Kämpfer	2013	7	Atmospheric Measurement Techniques				6	7	1725-1745		H2O, HDO, H217O, H218O	https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/6/1725/2013/		publications/pdfs/amt-6-1725-2013.pdf			10.5194/amt-6-1725-2013	f	Middle atmospheric water vapour can be used as a tracer for dynamical processes. It is mainly measured by satellite instruments and ground-based microwave radiometers. Ground-based instruments capable of measuring middle-atmospheric water vapour are sparse but valuable as they complement satellite measurements, are relatively easy to maintain and have a long lifetime. MIAWARA-C is a ground-based microwave radiometer for middle-atmospheric water vapour designed for use on measurement campaigns for both atmospheric case studies and instrument intercomparisons. MIAWARA-C's retrieval version 1.1 (v1.1) is set up in a such way as to provide a consistent data set even if the instrument is operated from different locations on a campaign basis. The sensitive altitude range for v1.1 extends from 4 hPa (37 km) to 0.017 hPa (75 km). For v1.1 the estimated systematic error is approximately 10% for all altitudes. At lower altitudes it is dominated by uncertainties in the calibration, with altitude the influence of spectroscopic and temperature uncertainties increases. The estimated random error increases with altitude from 5 to 25%. MIAWARA-C measures two polarisations of the incident radiation in separate receiver channels, and can therefore provide two measurements of the same air mass with independent instrumental noise. The standard deviation of the difference between the profiles obtained from the two polarisations is in excellent agreement with the estimated random measurement error of v1.1. In this paper, the quality of v1.1 data is assessed for measurements obtained at two different locations: (1) a total of 25 months of measurements in the Arctic (Sodankylä, 67.37° N, 26.63° E) and (2) nine months of measurements at mid-latitudes (Zimmerwald, 46.88° N, 7.46° E). For both locations MIAWARA-C's profiles are compared to measurements from the satellite experiments Aura MLS and MIPAS. In addition, comparisons to ACE-FTS and SOFIE are presented for the Arctic and to the ground-based radiometer MIAWARA for the mid-latitude campaigns. In general, all intercomparisons show high correlation coefficients, confirming the ability of MIAWARA-C to monitor temporal variations of the order of days. The biases are generally below 13% and within the estimated systematic uncertainty of MIAWARA-C. No consistent wet or dry bias is identified for MIAWARA-C. In addition, comparisons to the reference instruments indicate the estimated random error of v1.1 to be a realistic measure of the random variation on the retrieved profile between 45 and 70 km.		1

This overview paper outlines the scope and the general approach of RECONCILE, and it provides a summary of observations and modelling in 2010 and 2011 that have generated an in many respects unprecedented dataset to study processes in the Arctic winter stratosphere. Principally, it summarises important outcomes of RECONCILE including (i) better constraints and enhanced consistency on the set of parameters governing catalytic ozone destruction cycles, (ii) a better understanding of the role of cold binary aerosols in heterogeneous chlorine activation, (iii) an improved scheme of polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) processes that includes heterogeneous nucleation of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) and ice on non-volatile background aerosol leading to better model parameterisations with respect to denitrification, and (iv) long transient simulations with a chemistry-climate model (CCM) updated based on the results of RECONCILE that better reproduce past ozone trends in Antarctica and are deemed to produce more reliable predictions of future ozone trends. The process studies and the global simulations conducted in RECONCILE show that in the Arctic, ozone depletion uncertainties in the chemical and microphysical processes are now clearly smaller than the sensitivity to dynamic variability.		1

Specifically, we use measurements from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) for the period 1991–2005 and the NASA Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) for the period 2004–2013 to demonstrate a significant decrease in O3 near ~ 10 hPa in the tropics. O3 in this region is very sensitive to variations in NOy, and the observed decrease can be understood as a spatially localized, yet long-term increase in NOy. In turn, using data from MLS and from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE), we show that the NOy variations are caused by decreases in N2O which are likely linked to long-term variations in dynamics. To illustrate how variations in dynamics can affect N2O and O3, we show that by decreasing the upwelling in the tropics, more of the N2O can photodissociate with a concomitant increase in NOy production (via N2O + O(1D) → 2NO) at 10 hPa. Ultimately, this can cause an O3 decrease of the observed magnitude.		1

The primary intended use of this new temperature data set is to validate the merging of the Microwave Sounding Unit channel 4 (MSU4), and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit channel 9 (AMSU9) temperature time series conducted in previous studies. The six source data sets were merged by removing offsets and trends between the different measurement series. Weighted means were calculated of the six source data sets where the weights were a function of the uncertainty on the original monthly mean data. This new temperature data set of the upper troposphere and stratosphere has been validated by comparing it to RATPAC-A, COSMIC radio occultation data as well as the NCEPCFSR reanalyses. Differences in all three cases were typically < 2 K in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, but could reach up to 5 K in the mid-stratosphere. The data across the 17 pressure levels have then been vertically integrated, using the MSU4/AMSU9 weighting function, to provide a deep vertical layer temperature proxy of the merged MSU4+AMSU9 series. Differences between this vertically integrated data set and two different versions of the MSU4+AMSU9 data set – one from Remote Sensing Systems and one from the University of Alabama at Huntsville – were examined for discontinuities. No statistically significant discontinuities were found in either of those two data sets suggesting that the transition from the MSU4+AMSU9 data to AMSU9 data only does not introduce any discontinuities in the MSU4+AMSU9 climate data records that might compromise their use in temperature trend analyses.		1

A number of sensitivity runs is used to explore the impact of uncertainties in chlorine activation and denitrification on the model results. In particular, the efficiency of chlorine activation on different types of liquid aerosol versus activation on nitric acid trihydrate clouds is examined. Additionally, the impact of changes in reaction rate coefficients, in the particle number density of polar stratospheric clouds, in supersaturation, temperature or the extent of denitrification is investigated. Results are compared to satellite measurements of MLS and ACE-FTS and to in-situ measurements onboard the Geophysica aircraft during the RECONCILE measurement campaign. It is shown that even large changes in the underlying assumptions have only a small impact on the modelled ozone loss, even though they can cause considerable differences in chemical evolution of other species and in denitrification. Differences in column ozone between the sensitivity runs stay below 10% at the end of the winter. Chlorine activation on liquid aerosols alone is able to explain the observed magnitude and morphology of the mixing ratios of active chlorine, reservoir gases and ozone. This is even true for binary aerosols (no uptake of HNO3 from the gas-phase allowed in the model). Differences in chlorine activation between sensitivity runs are within 30%. Current estimates of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) number density and supersaturation imply that, at least for this winter, NAT clouds play a relatively small role compared to liquid clouds in chlorine activation. The change between different reaction rate coefficients for liquid or solid clouds has only a minor impact on ozone loss and chlorine activation in our sensitivity runs.		1

The satellite-based instrument Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer has been observing the Earth's limb since 2004 and derives profiles of N2O volume mixing ratios in the upper troposphere to the lower thermosphere. The resulting climatology shows that N2O is continuously produced in the lower thermosphere via energetic particle precipitation and enhanced N2O is present at all latitudes, during all seasons. The results are consistent with an N2O production source peaking near or above 94 km via low-energy particles, as well as a polar wintertime source near 70 km via medium energy particles. N2O produced in the polar upper atmosphere descends each winter to as far down as ~40 km.		1

This instrument has been making regular solar occultation observations for more than nine years. The current ACE-FTS data version (version 3.0) provides profiles of temperature and volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of more than 30 atmospheric trace gas species, as well as 20 subsidiary isotopologues of the most abundant trace atmospheric constituents over a latitude range of ~85°N to ~85°S.

We find that WACCM can reproduce the observed distribution of CO2 in the MLT and the rapid falloff of CO2 above about 80 km. Analysis of the principal terms in the calculated budget of CO2 shows that its global-mean vertical profile is determined mainly by the competition between molecular diffusive separation and eddy mixing by gravity waves. The model underestimates somewhat the mixing ratio of CO2 in the thermosphere compared to that in the observations, but we show that the discrepancy may be eliminated by a reasonable adjustment of the Prandtl number used to calculate the diffusivity due to gravity waves. Simulated CO is also consistent with observations, except that in the standard version of the model, its mixing ratio is uniformly lower than observed above about 100 km. We conclude that WACCM likely underestimates the rate of production of CO in the lower thermosphere from photolysis of CO2 at wavelengths < 121 nm, and we show that this stems from the use of a very large absorption cross section for O2 in the wavelength range 105–121 nm. When a smaller cross section is used, photolysis of CO2 increases by a factor of 2–3 at ~ 95–115 km and, as a result, CO mixing ratios become larger and agree much more closely with observations. We emphasize that the increase in CO2 photolysis implies only minor changes in the vertical profile of CO2 because photolytic loss is a minor term in the budget of CO2 in the MLT.		1

We present fluorine budgets using organic and inorganic species retrieved by the ACE-FTS satellite instrument supplemented with output from the SLIMCAT 3-D chemical transport model. The budgets are calculated between 2004 and 2009 for a number of latitude bands: 70–30° N, 30–00° N, 00° N–30° S, and 30–70° S. At lower altitudes total fluorine profiles are dominated by the contribution from CFC-12, up to an altitude of 20 km in the extra-tropics and 29 km in the tropics; above these altitudes the profiles are dominated by hydrogen fluoride (HF). Our data show that total fluorine profiles at all locations have a negative slope with altitude, providing evidence that overall fluorine emissions (measured by their F content) have been increasing with time. Total stratospheric fluorine is increasing at a similar rate in the tropics: 32.5 ± 4.9 ppt yr−1 (1.31 ± 0.20% per year) in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and 29.8 ± 5.3 ppt yr−1 (1.21 ± 0.22% per year) in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Extra-tropical total stratospheric fluorine is also increasing at a similar rate in both the NH and SH: 28.3 ± 2.7 ppt per year (1.12 ± 0.11% per year) in the NH and 24.3 ± 3.1 ppt per year (0.96 ± 0.12% per year) in the SH. The calculation of radiative efficiency-weighted total fluorine allows the changes in radiative forcing between 2004 and 2009 to be calculated. These results show an increase in radiative forcing of between 0.23 ± 0.11% per year and 0.45 ± 0.11% per year, due to the increase in fluorine-containing species during this time. The decreasing trends in the mixing ratios of halons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), due to their prohibition under the Montreal Protocol, have suppressed an increase in total fluorine caused by increasing mixing ratios of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

These profiles have been compared to measurements taken by the balloon-borne cryosampler, Mark IV (MkIV) and MIPAS-Balloon (MIPAS-B), the airborne MIPAS-STRatospheric aircraft (MIPAS-STR), the satellite-borne Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and the High Resolution Dynamic Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), as well as the ground-based Halocarbon and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS) network for the reduced spectral resolution period (RR: January 2005–April 2012) of MIPAS. ACE-FTS, MkIV and HATS also provide measurements during the high spectral resolution period (full resolution, FR: July 2002–March 2004) and were used to validate MIPAS CFC-11 and CFC-12 products during that time, as well as profiles from the Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer, ILAS-II. In general, we find that MIPAS shows slightly higher values for CFC-11 at the lower end of the profiles (below  ∼  15 km) and in a comparison of HATS ground-based data and MIPAS measurements at 3 km below the tropopause. Differences range from approximately 10 to 50 pptv ( ∼  5–20 %) during the RR period. In general, differences are slightly smaller for the FR period. An indication of a slight high bias at the lower end of the profile exists for CFC-12 as well, but this bias is far less pronounced than for CFC-11 and is not as obvious in the relative differences between MIPAS and any of the comparison instruments. Differences at the lower end of the profile (below  ∼  15 km) and in the comparison of HATS and MIPAS measurements taken at 3 km below the tropopause mainly stay within 10–50 pptv (corresponding to  ∼  2–10 % for CFC-12) for the RR and the FR period. Between  ∼  15 and 30 km, most comparisons agree within 10–20 pptv (10–20 %), apart from ILAS-II, which shows large differences above  ∼  17 km. Overall, relative differences are usually smaller for CFC-12 than for CFC-11. For both species – CFC-11 and CFC-12 – we find that differences at the lower end of the profile tend to be larger at higher latitudes than in tropical and subtropical regions. In addition, MIPAS profiles have a maximum in their mixing ratio around the tropopause, which is most obvious in tropical mean profiles. Comparisons of the standard deviation in a quiescent atmosphere (polar summer) show that only the CFC-12 FR error budget can fully explain the observed variability, while for the other products (CFC-11 FR and RR and CFC-12 RR) only two-thirds to three-quarters can be explained. Investigations regarding the temporal stability show very small negative drifts in MIPAS CFC-11 measurements. These instrument drifts vary between  ∼  1 and 3 % decade−1. For CFC-12, the drifts are also negative and close to zero up to  ∼  30 km. Above that altitude, larger drifts of up to  ∼  50 % decade−1 appear which are negative up to  ∼  35 km and positive, but of a similar magnitude, above.		1

Recent observations by Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the CALIPSO satellite have been explained in terms of heterogeneous nucleation of NAT on foreign nuclei, revealing this to be an important formation pathway for the NAT particles. In state of the art global- or regional-scale models, heterogeneous NAT nucleation is currently simulated in a very coarse manner using a constant, saturation-independent nucleation rate. Here we present first simulations for the Arctic winter 2009/2010 applying a new saturation-dependent parametrisation of heterogeneous NAT nucleation rates within the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). The simulation shows good agreement of chemical trace species with in situ and remote sensing observations. The simulated polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) optical properties agree much better with CALIOP observations than those simulated with a constant nucleation rate model. A comparison of the simulated particle size distributions with observations made using the Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) aboard the high altitude research aircraft Geophysica, shows that the model reproduces the observed size distribution, except for the very largest particles above 15 μm diameter. The vertical NOy redistribution caused by the sedimentation of the NAT particles, in particular the denitrification and nitrification signals observed by the ACE-FTS satellite instrument and the in situ SIOUX instrument aboard the Geophysica, are reproduced by the improved model, and a small improvement with respect to the constant nucleation rate model is found.		1

These molecules slowly degrade in the atmosphere, leading to the formation of HF, COF2, and COClF, which are the main fluorine-containing species in the stratosphere. Ultimately both COF2 and COClF further degrade to form HF, an almost permanent reservoir of stratospheric fluorine due to its extreme stability. Carbonyl fluoride (COF2) is the second-most abundant stratospheric "inorganic" fluorine reservoir, with main sources being the atmospheric degradation of CFC-12 (CCl2F2), HCFC-22 (CHF2Cl), and CFC-113 (CF2ClCFCl2). \r\n\r\nThis work reports the first global distributions of carbonyl fluoride in the Earth's atmosphere using infrared satellite remote-sensing measurements by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS), which has been recording atmospheric spectra since 2004, and the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instrument, which recorded thermal emission atmospheric spectra between 2002 and 2012. The observations reveal a high degree of seasonal and latitudinal variability over the course of a year. These have been compared with the output of SLIMCAT, a state-of-the-art three-dimensional chemical transport model. In general the observations agree well with each other, although MIPAS is biased high by as much as ~30%, and compare well with SLIMCAT. \r\n\r\nBetween January 2004 and September 2010 COF2 grew most rapidly at altitudes above ~25 km in the southern latitudes and at altitudes below ~25 km in the northern latitudes, whereas it declined most rapidly in the tropics. These variations are attributed to changes in stratospheric dynamics over the observation period. The overall COF2 global trend over this period is calculated as 0.85 ± 0.34 (MIPAS), 0.30 ± 0.44 (ACE), and 0.88% year−1 (SLIMCAT).		1

We use measurements of ClO, HCl, ClONO2, and other species from MLS and ACE-FTS to study the evolution of reactive and reservoir chlorine throughout the lower stratosphere during two Arctic and two Antarctic winters characterizing both relatively cold and relatively warm and disturbed conditions in each hemisphere. At middle latitudes, and at high latitudes at the beginning of winter, HCl greatly exceeds ClONO2, representing ∼0.7–0.8 of estimated total inorganic chlorine. Nearly complete chlorine activation is seen inside the winter polar vortices. In the Arctic, chlorine recovery follows different paths in the two winters: In 2004/2005, deactivation initially takes place through reformation of ClONO2, then both reservoirs are produced concurrently but ClONO2 continues to significantly exceed HCl, and finally slow repartitioning between ClONO2 and HCl occurs; in 2005/2006, HCl and ClONO2 rise at comparable rates in some regions. In the Antarctic, chlorine deactivation proceeds in a similar manner in both winters, with a rapid rise in HCl accompanying the decrease in ClO. The measurements are compared to customized runs of the SLIMCAT three-dimensional chemical transport model. Measured and modeled values typically agree well outside the winter polar regions. In contrast, partly because of the equilibrium scheme used to parameterize polar stratospheric clouds, the model overestimates the magnitude, spatial extent, and duration of chlorine activation inside the polar vortices.		1

Detection and attribution of the expected recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer in an atmosphere with reduced ODSs as well as efforts to understand the evolution of stratospheric ozone in the presence of increasing greenhouse gases are key current research topics. These require a critical examination of the ozone changes with an accurate knowledge of the spatial (geographical and vertical) and temporal ozone response. For such an examination, it is vital that the quality of the measurements used be as high as possible and measurement uncertainties well quantified. \r\n\r\nIn preparation for the 2014 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion, the SPARC/IO3C/IGACO-O3/NDACC (SI2N) Initiative was designed to study and document changes in the global ozone profile distribution. This requires assessing long-term ozone profile data sets in regards to measurement stability and uncertainty characteristics. The ultimate goal is to establish suitability for estimating long-term ozone trends to contribute to ozone recovery studies. Some of the data sets have been improved as part of this initiative with updated versions now available. \r\n\r\nThis summary presents an overview of stratospheric ozone profile measurement data sets (ground and satellite based) available for ozone recovery studies. Here we document measurement techniques, spatial and temporal coverage, vertical resolution, native units and measurement uncertainties. In addition, the latest data versions are briefly described (including data version updates as well as detailing multiple retrievals when available for a given satellite instrument). Archive location information for each data set is also given.		1

These were the two largest SPE periods of solar cycle 24 so far. The highly energetic solar protons produced considerable ionization of the neutral atmosphere as well as HOx (H, OH, HO2) and NOx (N, NO, NO2). We compute a NOx production of 1.9 and 2.1 Gigamoles due to these SPE periods in January and March 2012, respectively, which places these SPE periods among the 12 largest in the past 50 yr. Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations of the peroxy radical, HO2, show significant enhancements of > 0.9 ppbv in the northern polar mesosphere as a result of these SPE periods. Both MLS measurements and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) two-dimensional (2-D) model predictions indicated middle mesospheric ozone decreases of > 20% for several days in the northern polar region with maximum depletions > 60% over 1–2 days as a result of the HOx produced in both the January and March 2012 SPE periods. The SCISAT-1 Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE) and the Envisat Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instruments measured NO and NO2 (~ NOx), which indicated enhancements of over 20 ppbv in most of the northern polar mesosphere for several days as a result of these SPE periods. The GSFC 2-D model and the Global Modeling Initiative three-dimensional chemistry and transport model were used to predict the medium-term (~ months) influence and showed that the polar middle atmospheric ozone was most affected by these solar events in the Southern Hemisphere due to the increased downward motion in the fall and early winter. The downward transport moved the SPE-produced NOy to lower altitudes and led to predicted modest destruction of ozone (5–13%) in the upper stratosphere days to weeks after the March 2012 event. Polar total ozone reductions were predicted to be a maximum of 1.5% in 2012 due to these SPEs.		1

The improved spectroscopic parameters include C2H6 pseudo-lines in the 2720–3100 cm−1 range and updated line parameters for methyl chloride and ozone. These improved spectroscopic parameters allow for substantial reduction of the fitting residuals as well as enhanced information content. They also contribute to limiting oscillations responsible for ungeophysical negative mixing ratio profiles. This strategy has been successfully applied to the Jungfraujoch solar spectra available from 1994 onwards. The resulting time series is compared with C2H6 total columns simulated by the state-of-the-art chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. Despite very consistent seasonal cycles between both data sets, a negative systematic bias relative to the FTIR observations suggests that C2H6 emissions are underestimated in the current inventories implemented in GEOS-Chem. Finally, C2H6 trends are derived from the FTIR time series, revealing a statistically-significant sharp increase of the C2H6 burden in the remote atmosphere above Jungfraujoch since 2009. Evaluating cause of this change in the C2H6 burden, which may be related to the recent massive growth of shale gas exploitation in North America, is of primary importance for atmospheric composition and air quality in the Northern Hemisphere.		1

The longest available record from balloon observations over Boulder, Colorado, USA shows increases in stratospheric water vapour concentrations that cannot be fully explained by observed changes in the main drivers, tropical tropopause temperatures and methane. Satellite observations could help resolve the issue, but constructing a reliable long-term data record from individual short satellite records is challenging. Here we present an approach to merge satellite data sets with the help of a chemistry-climate model nudged to observed meteorology. We use the models' water vapour as a transfer function between data sets that overcomes issues arising from instrument drift and short overlap periods. In the lower stratosphere, our water vapour record extends back to 1988 and water vapour concentrations largely follow tropical tropopause temperatures. Lower and mid-stratospheric long-term trends are negative, and the trends from Boulder are shown not to be globally representative. In the upper stratosphere, our record extends back to 1986 and shows positive long-term trends. The altitudinal differences in the trends are explained by methane oxidation together with a strengthened lower-stratospheric and a weakened upper-stratospheric circulation inferred by this analysis. Our results call into question previous estimates of surface radiative forcing based on presumed global long-term increases in water vapour concentrations in the lower stratosphere.	17520894	1

The stratospheric lifetimes of CFCs are a measure of their stratospheric loss rates that are needed to determine global warming and ozone depletion potentials. We applied the tracer–tracer correlation approach to zonal mean climatologies from satellite measurements and model data to assess the lifetimes of CFCl3 (CFC-11) and CF2Cl2 (CFC-12). We present estimates of the CFC-11/CFC-12 lifetime ratio and the absolute lifetime of CFC-12, based on a reference lifetime of 52 years for CFC-11. We analyzed climatologies from three satellite missions, the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), the HIgh Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), and the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). We found a CFC-11/CFC-12 lifetime ratio of 0.47±0.08 and a CFC-12 lifetime of 112(96–133) years for ACE-FTS, a ratio of 0.46±0.07 and a lifetime of 113(97–134) years for HIRDLS, and a ratio of 0.46±0.08 and a lifetime of 114(98–136) years for MIPAS. The error-weighted, combined CFC-11/CFC-12 lifetime ratio is 0.46±0.04 and the CFC-12 lifetime estimate is 113(103–124) years. These results agree with the recent Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC) reassessment, which recommends lifetimes of 52(43–67) years and 102(88–122) years, respectively. Having smaller uncertainties than the results from other recent studies, our estimates can help to better constrain CFC-11 and CFC-12 lifetime recommendations in future scientific studies and assessments. Furthermore, the satellite observations were used to validate first simulation results from a new coupled model system, which integrates a Lagrangian chemistry transport model into a climate model. For the coupled model we found a CFC-11/CFC-12 lifetime ratio of 0.48±0.07 and a CFC-12 lifetime of 110(95–129) years, based on a 10-year perpetual run. Closely reproducing the satellite observations, the new model system will likely become a useful tool to assess the impact of advective transport, mixing, and photochemistry as well as climatological variability on the stratospheric lifetimes of long-lived tracers.		1

MLS and solar occultation data are analyzed using DMPs to illustrate sampling issues that may affect interpretation and comparison of data sets with diverse sampling patterns and to provide guidance regarding the kinds of studies that benefit most from analyzing satellite data in relation to meteorological conditions using the DMPs. Using EqL or PV as a vortex-centered coordinate does not alleviate all sampling problems, including those in studies using “vortex averages” of solar occultation data and in analyses of localized features (such as polar stratospheric clouds) and other fields that do not correlate well with PV. Using DMPs to view measurements with respect to their air mass characteristics is particularly valuable in studies of transport of long-lived trace gases, polar processing in the winter lower stratosphere, and distributions and transport of O3 and other trace gases from the upper troposphere through the lower stratosphere. The comparisons shown here demonstrate good agreement between MLS and solar occultation data for O3, N2O, H2O, HNO3, and HCl; small biases are attributable to sampling effects or are consistent with detailed validation results presented elsewhere in this special section. The DMPs are valuable for many scientific studies and to facilitate validation of noncoincident measurements.		1

The data cover the period from January 2005 to April 2012 and the altitude range from the upper troposphere (above cloud top altitude) to about 50 km. The profile retrieval was performed by constrained nonlinear least squares fitting of modelled spectra to the measured limb spectral radiances. The spectral ν4-band at 816.5 ± 13 cm−1 was used for the retrieval. A Tikhonov-type smoothing constraint was applied to stabilise the retrieval. In the lower stratosphere, we find a global volume mixing ratio of HCFC-22 of about 185 pptv in January 2005. The rate of linear growth in the lower latitudes lower stratosphere was about 6 to 7 pptv year−1 in the period 2005–2012. The profiles obtained were compared with ACE-FTS satellite data v3.5, as well as with MkIV balloon profiles and cryosampler balloon measurements. Between 13 and 22 km, average agreement within −3 to +5 pptv (MIPAS – ACE) with ACE-FTS v3.5 profiles is demonstrated. Agreement with MkIV solar occultation balloon-borne measurements is within 10–20 pptv below 30 km and worse above, while in situ cryosampler balloon measurements are systematically lower over their full altitude range by 15–50 pptv below 24 km and less than 10 pptv above 28 km. MIPAS HCFC-22 time series below 10 km altitude are shown to agree mostly well to corresponding time series of near-surface abundances from the NOAA/ESRL and AGAGE networks, although a more pronounced seasonal cycle is obvious in the satellite data. This is attributed to tropopause altitude fluctuations and subsidence of polar winter stratospheric air into the troposphere. A parametric model consisting of constant, linear, quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and several sine and cosine terms with different periods has been fitted to the temporal variation of stratospheric HCFC-22 for all 10°-latitude/1-to-2-km-altitude bins. The relative linear variation was always positive, with relative increases of 40–70 % decade−1 in the tropics and global lower stratosphere, and up to 120 % decade−1 in the upper stratosphere of the northern polar region and the southern extratropical hemisphere. Asian HCFC-22 emissions have become the major source of global upper tropospheric HCFC-22. In the upper troposphere, monsoon air, rich in HCFC-22, is instantaneously mixed into the tropics. In the middle stratosphere, between 20 and 30 km, the observed trend is inconsistent with the trend at the surface (corrected for the age of stratospheric air), hinting at circulation changes. There exists a stronger positive trend in HCFC-22 in the Southern Hemisphere and a more muted positive trend in the Northern Hemisphere, implying a potential change in the stratospheric circulation over the observation period.		1

This data set is a global long-term stratospheric Earth system data record, consisting of monthly zonal mean time series starting as early as 1979. The data records are based on high-quality measurements from several NASA satellite instruments and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on SCISAT. We examine consistency aspects between the various data sets. To merge ozone records, the time series are debiased relative to SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiments) values by calculating average offsets versus SAGE II during measurement overlap periods, whereas for other species the merging derives from an averaging procedure during overlap periods. The GOZCARDS files contain mixing ratios on a common pressure–latitude grid, as well as standard errors and other diagnostics; we also present estimates of systematic uncertainties in the merged products. Monthly mean temperatures for GOZCARDS were also produced, based directly on data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications. \r\n\r\nThe GOZCARDS HCl merged product comes from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), ACE-FTS and lower-stratospheric Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data. After a rapid rise in upper-stratospheric HCl in the early 1990s, the rate of decrease in this region for 1997–2010 was between 0.4 and 0.7 % yr−1. On 6–8-year timescales, the rate of decrease peaked in 2004–2005 at about 1 % yr−1, and it has since levelled off, at ~ 0.5 % yr−1. With a delay of 6–7 years, these changes roughly follow total surface chlorine, whose behavior versus time arises from inhomogeneous changes in the source gases. Since the late 1990s, HCl decreases in the lower stratosphere have occurred with pronounced latitudinal variability at rates sometimes exceeding 1–2 % yr−1. Recent short-term tendencies of lower-stratospheric and column HCl vary substantially, with increases from 2005 to 2010 for northern midlatitudes and deep tropics, but decreases (increases) after 2011 at northern (southern) midlatitudes. \r\n\r\nFor H2O, the GOZCARDS product covers both stratosphere and mesosphere, and the same instruments as for HCl are used, along with Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) MLS stratospheric H2O data (1991–1993). We display seasonal to decadal-type variability in H2O from 22 years of data. In the upper mesosphere, the anticorrelation between H2O and solar flux is now clearly visible over two full solar cycles. Lower-stratospheric tropical H2O has exhibited two periods of increasing values, followed by fairly sharp drops (the well-documented 2000–2001 decrease and a recent drop in 2011–2013). Tropical decadal variability peaks just above the tropopause. Between 1991 and 2013, both in the tropics and on a near-global basis, H2O has decreased by ~ 5–10 % in the lower stratosphere, but about a 10 % increase is observed in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. However, such tendencies may not represent longer-term trends. \r\n\r\nFor ozone, we used SAGE I, SAGE II, HALOE, UARS and Aura MLS, and ACE-FTS data to produce a merged record from late 1979 onward, using SAGE II as the primary reference. Unlike the 2 to 3 % increase in near-global column ozone after the late 1990s reported by some, GOZCARDS stratospheric column O3 values do not show a recent upturn of more than 0.5 to 1 %; long-term interannual column ozone variations from GOZCARDS are generally in very good agreement with interannual changes in merged total column ozone (Version 8.6) data from SBUV instruments. \r\n\r\nA brief mention is also made of other currently available, commonly formatted GOZCARDS satellite data records for stratospheric composition, namely those for N2O and HNO3.		1

It is based on a set of coupled differential equations that simulate the seasonal evolution of vortex-averaged hydrogen chloride (HCl), nitric acid (HNO3), chlorine nitrate (ClONO2), active forms of chlorine (ClOx = Cl + ClO + 2 ClOOCl) and ozone (O3) on isentropic levels within the polar vortices. Terms in these equations account for the chemical and physical processes driving the time rate of change of these species. Eight empirical fit coefficients associated with these terms are derived by iteratively fitting the equations to vortex-averaged satellite-based measurements of HCl, HNO3 and ClONO2 and observationally derived ozone loss rates. The system of differential equations is not stiff and can be solved with a time step of one day, allowing many years to be processed per second on a standard PC. The inputs required are the daily fractions of the vortex area covered by polar stratospheric clouds and the fractions of the vortex area exposed to sunlight. The resultant model, SWIFT (Semi-empirical Weighted Iterative Fit Technique), provides a fast yet accurate method to simulate ozone loss rates in polar regions. SWIFT's capabilities are demonstrated by comparing measured and modeled total ozone loss outside of the training period.		1

The time period covered corresponds to the reduced spectral resolution period of the MIPAS instrument, i.e., January 2005–April 2012. The comparison with satellite instruments includes all post-2005 satellite limb and occultation sensors that have measured the vertical profiles of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone: ACE-FTS, GOMOS, HALOE, HIRDLS, MLS, OSIRIS, POAM, SAGE II, SCIAMACHY, SMILES, and SMR. In addition, balloon-borne MkIV solar occultation measurements and ground-based Umkehr measurements have been included, as well as two nadir sensors: IASI and SBUV. For each reference data set, bias determination and precision assessment are performed. Better agreement with reference instruments than for the previous data version, V5R_O3_220 (Laeng et al., 2014), is found: the known high bias around the ozone vmr (volume mixing ratio) peak is significantly reduced and the vertical resolution at 35 km has been improved. The agreement with limb and solar occultation reference instruments that have a known small bias vs. ozonesondes is within 7% in the lower and middle stratosphere and 5% in the upper troposphere. Around the ozone vmr peak, the agreement with most of the satellite reference instruments is within 5%; this bias is as low as 3% for ACE-FTS, MLS, OSIRIS, POAM and SBUV.		1

The chemical inertness of chlorofluorocarbons allows their transport and mixing throughout the troposphere on a global scale1, before they reach the stratosphere where they release chlorine atoms that cause ozone depletion2. The large ozone loss over Antarctica3 was the key observation that stimulated the definition and signing in 1987 of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty establishing a schedule to reduce the production of the major chlorine- and bromine-containing halocarbons. Owing to its implementation, the near-surface total chlorine concentration showed a maximum in 1993, followed by a decrease of half a per cent to one per cent per year4, in line with expectations. Remote-sensing data have revealed a peak in stratospheric chlorine after 19965, then a decrease of close to one per cent per year6, 7, in agreement with the surface observations of the chlorine source gases and model calculations7. Here we present ground-based and satellite data that show a recent and significant increase, at the 2σ level, in hydrogen chloride (HCl), the main stratospheric chlorine reservoir, starting around 2007 in the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, in contrast with the ongoing monotonic decrease of near-surface source gases. Using model simulations, we attribute this trend anomaly to a slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, occurring over several consecutive years, transporting more aged air to the lower stratosphere, and characterized by a larger relative conversion of source gases to HCl. This short-term dynamical variability will also affect other stratospheric tracers and needs to be accounted for when studying the evolution of the stratospheric ozone layer.		1

However, few of these measurements reach into the upper troposphere, thus hindering MOPITT validation in that region. Here we evaluate upper tropospheric (~500 hPa to the tropopause) MOPITT CO profiles by comparing them to satellite Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) retrievals and to measurements from the High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research Pole to Pole Observations (HIPPO) Quantum Cascade Laser Spectrometer (QCLS). Direct comparison of colocated v5 MOPITT thermal infrared-only retrievals, v3.0 ACE-FTS retrievals, and HIPPO-QCLS measurements shows a slight positive MOPITT CO bias within its 10% accuracy requirement with respect to the other two data sets. Direct comparison of colocated ACE-FTS and HIPPO-QCLS measurements results in a small number of samples due to the large disparity in sampling pattern and density of these data sets. Thus, two additional indirect techniques for comparison of noncoincident data sets have been applied: tracer-tracer (CO-O3) correlation analysis and analysis of profiles in tropopause coordinates. These techniques suggest a negative bias of ACE-FTS with respect to HIPPO-QCLS; this could be caused by differences in resolution (horizontal, vertical) or by deficiencies in the ACE-FTS CO retrievals below ~20 km of altitude, among others. We also investigate the temporal stability of MOPITT and ACE-FTS data, which provide unique global CO records and are thus important in climate analysis. Our results indicate that the relative bias between the two data sets has remained generally stable during the 2004–2010 period.		1

HCN is an almost unambiguous tracer of biomass burning with a tropospheric lifetime of 5–6 months and a stratospheric lifetime of about 2 years. The MIPAS climatology is in good agreement with the HCN distribution obtained by the spaceborne ACE-FTS experiment and with airborne in situ measurements performed during the INTEX-B campaign. The HCN amounts observed by MIPAS in the southern tropical and subtropical upper troposphere have an annual cycle peaking in October–November, i.e. 1–2 months after the maximum of southern hemispheric fire emissions. The probable reason for the time shift is the delayed onset of deep convection towards austral summer. Because of overlap of varying biomass burning emissions from South America and southern Africa with sporadically strong contributions from Indonesia, the size and strength of the southern hemispheric plume have considerable interannual variations, with monthly mean maxima at, for example, 14 km between 400 and more than 700 pptv. Within 1–2 months after appearance of the plume, a considerable portion of the enhanced HCN is transported southward to as far as Antarctic latitudes. The fundamental period of HCN variability in the northern upper troposphere is also an annual cycle with varying amplitude, which in the tropics peaks in May after and during the biomass burning seasons in northern tropical Africa and southern Asia, and in the subtropics peaks in July due to trapping of pollutants in the Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA). However, caused by extensive biomass burning in Indonesia and by northward transport of part of the southern hemispheric plume, northern HCN maxima also occur around October/November in several years, which leads to semi-annual cycles. There is also a temporal shift between enhanced HCN in northern low and mid- to high latitudes, indicating northward transport of pollutants. Due to additional biomass burning at mid- and high latitudes, this meridional transport pattern is not as clear as in the Southern Hemisphere. Upper tropospheric HCN volume mixing ratios (VMRs) above the tropical oceans decrease to below 200 pptv, presumably caused by ocean uptake, especially during boreal winter and spring. The tropical stratospheric tape recorder signal with an apparently biennial period, which was detected in MLS and ACE-FTS data from mid-2004 to mid-2007, is corroborated by MIPAS HCN data. The tape recorder signal in the whole MIPAS data set exhibits periodicities of 2 and 4 years, which are generated by interannual variations in biomass burning. The positive anomalies of the years 2003, 2007 and 2011 are caused by succession of strongly enhanced HCN from southern hemispheric and Indonesian biomass burning in boreal autumn and of elevated HCN from northern tropical Africa and the AMA in subsequent spring and summer. The anomaly of 2005 seems to be due to springtime emissions from tropical Africa followed by release from the summertime AMA. The vertical transport time of the anomalies is 1 month or less between 14 and 17 km in the upper troposphere and 8–11 months between 17 and 25 km in the lower stratosphere.		1

The derivation method is based on empirical relationships between these species established using observations from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment---Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on the SCISAT I satellite. The observed correlation between CH4 and N2O from ACE-FTS is used to derive CH4 from MLS measurements of N2O in the lower stratosphere, extending from a pressure of 100 hPa to a range of 30--10 hPa, depending on atmospheric conditions. In the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, between 30--10 hPa and 0.1 hPa, correlations between CH4 and H2O are used to derive CH4 from MLS measurements of H2O. Coincident MLS measurements of CO are utilized to separate two distinct air mass regimes in the CH4 - H2O relationship. This new methane data set covers all seasons and latitudes observed by MLS over the course of the Aura mission from 2004 to 2014. Examples are shown demonstrating the consistency of MLS derived CH4 with other trace gas measurements.		1

The main challenge is to find an atmospheric phenomenon which can be used for accurate tangent height determination in the lower atmosphere, where the tangent heights (THs) calculated from geometric and timing information are not of sufficient accuracy. Error budgets for the retrieval of CO2 from ACE-FTS and the FTS on a potential follow-on mission named CASS (Chemical and Aerosol Sounding Satellite) are calculated and contrasted. Retrieved THs have typical biases of 60 m relative to those retrieved using the ACE version 3.x software after revisiting the temperature dependence of the N2 CIA (collision-induced absorption) laboratory measurements and accounting for sulfate aerosol extinction. After correcting for the known residual high bias of ACE version 3.x THs expected from CO2 spectroscopic/isotopic inconsistencies, the remaining bias for tangent heights determined with the N2 CIA is −20 m. CO2 in the 5–13 km range in the 2009–2011 time frame is validated against aircraft measurements from CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container), CONTRAIL (Comprehensive Observation Network for Trace gases by Airline), and HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations), yielding typical biases of −1.7 ppm in the 5–13 km range. The standard error of these biases in this vertical range is 0.4 ppm. The multi-year ACE-FTS data set is valuable in determining the seasonal variation of the latitudinal gradient which arises from the strong seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere. The annual growth of CO2 in this time frame is determined to be 2.6 ± 0.4 ppm year−1, in agreement with the currently accepted global growth rate based on ground-based measurements.		1

We derived an enrichment δ18OOO in the stratosphere and the lower mesosphere from observations of the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) onboard the International Space Station (ISS) using a retrieval algorithm optimized for the isotopic ratio. The retrieval algorithm includes (i) an a priori covariance matrix constrained by oxygen isotopic ratios in ozone, (ii) an optimization of spectral windows for ozone isotopomers and isotopologues, and (iii) common tangent height information for all windows. The δ18OOO by averaging the SMILES measurements at the latitude range of 20 to 40° N from February to March in 2010 with solar zenith angle < 80° was 13% (at 32 km) with the systematic error of about 5%. SMILES and past measurements were in good agreement, with δ18OOO increasing with altitude between 30 and 40 km. The vertical profile of δ18OOO obtained in this study showed an increase and a decrease with altitude in the stratosphere and mesosphere, respectively. The δ18OOO peak, 18%, is found at the stratopause. The δ18OOO has a positive correlation with temperature in the range of 220–255 K, indicating that temperature can be a dominant factor to control the vertical profile of δ18OOO in the stratosphere and mesosphere. This is the first report of the observation of δ18OOO over a wide altitude range extending from the stratosphere to the mesosphere (28–57 km).		1

We use the daily zonal mean data in that altitude range for the years 2004–2010 (ACE-FTS), 2005–2012 (MIPAS), 2008–2012 (SCIAMACHY), and 2003–2012 (SMR). \r\n\r\nWe first compare the data qualitatively with respect to the morphology, focussing on the major features, and then compare the time series directly and quantitatively. In three geographical regions, we compare the vertical density profiles on coincident measurement days. Since none of the instruments delivers continuous daily measurements in this altitude region, we carried out a multi-linear regression analysis. This regression analysis considers annual and semi-annual variability in the form of harmonic terms and inter-annual variability by responding linearly to the solar Lyman-α radiation index and the geomagnetic Kp index. This analysis helps to find similarities and differences in the individual data sets with respect to the inter-annual variations caused by geomagnetic and solar variability. \r\n\r\nWe find that the data sets are consistent and that they only disagree on minor aspects. SMR and ACE-FTS deliver the longest time series in the mesosphere, and they agree with each other remarkably well. The shorter time series from MIPAS and SCIAMACHY also agree with them where they overlap. The data agree within 30 % when the number densities are large, but they can differ by 50 to 100 % in some cases.		1

The observation mode was activated during June, July and August of 2010 and 2011, and for latitudes between 50 and 82° N. \r\n\r\nThis paper focuses on the water vapour and temperature measurements carried out with Odin's sub-millimetre radiometer (SMR). The tomographic retrieval approach used provides water vapour and temperature between 75 and 90 km with a vertical resolution of about 2.5 km and a horizontal resolution of about 200 km. The precision of the measurements is estimated to 0.2 ppmv for water vapour and 2 K for temperature. Due to limited information about the pressure at the measured altitudes, the results have large uncertainties (> 3 ppmv) in the retrieved water vapour. These errors, however, influence mainly the mean atmosphere retrieved for each orbit, and variations around this mean are still reliably captured by the measurements. \r\n\r\nSMR measurements are performed using two different mixer chains, denoted as frequency mode 19 and 13. Systematic differences between the two frontends have been noted. A first comparison with the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment instrument (SOFIE) on-board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite and the Fourier Transform Spectrometer of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE-FTS) on-board SCISAT indicates that the measurements using the frequency mode 19 have a significant low bias in both temperature (> 15 K) and water vapour (> 0.5 ppmv), while the measurements using frequency mode 13 agree with the other instruments considering estimated errors. \r\n\r\nPMC brightness data is provided by OSIRIS, Odin's other sensor. Combined SMR and OSIRIS data for some example orbits is considered. For these orbits, effects of PMCs on the water vapour distribution are clearly seen. Areas depleted of water vapour are found above layers with PMC, while regions of enhanced water vapour due to ice particle sedimentation are primarily placed between and under the clouds.		1

Trajectories are initialized in the upper troposphere, and the circulation is based on reanalysis wind fields. In addition, chemical production and loss rates along trajectories are included using calculations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). The trajectory model results show good overall agreement with satellite observations from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) in terms of spatial structure and seasonal variability. The trajectory model results also agree well with the Eulerian WACCM simulations. Analysis of the simulated tracers shows that seasonal variations in tropical upwelling exerts strong influence on O3 and CO in the tropical lower stratosphere, and the coupled seasonal cycles provide a useful test of the transport simulations. Interannual variations in the tracers are also closely coupled to changes in upwelling, and the trajectory model can accurately capture and explain observed changes during 2005–2011. This demonstrates the importance of variability in tropical upwelling in forcing chemical changes in the tropical lower stratosphere.		1

Chemistry-transport models (CTMs) therefore need to simulate the tropospheric and stratospheric fractional columns of XCH4 accurately for estimating surface emissions from XCH4. Simulations from three CTMs are tested against XCH4 observations from the Total Carbon Column Network (TCCON). We analyze how the model–TCCON agreement in XCH4 depends on the model representation of stratospheric CH4 distributions. Model equivalents of TCCON XCH4 are computed with stratospheric CH4 fields from both the model simulations and from satellite-based CH4 distributions from MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) and MIPAS CH4 fields adjusted to ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer) observations. Using MIPAS-based stratospheric CH4 fields in place of model simulations improves the model–TCCON XCH4 agreement for all models. For the Atmospheric Chemistry Transport Model (ACTM) the average XCH4 bias is significantly reduced from 38.1 to 13.7 ppb, whereas small improvements are found for the models TM5 (Transport Model, version 5; from 8.7 to 4.3 ppb) and LMDz (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique model with zooming capability; from 6.8 to 4.3 ppb). Replacing model simulations with MIPAS stratospheric CH4 fields adjusted to ACE-FTS reduces the average XCH4 bias for ACTM (3.3 ppb), but increases the average XCH4 bias for TM5 (10.8 ppb) and LMDz (20.0 ppb). These findings imply that model errors in simulating stratospheric CH4 contribute to model biases. Current satellite instruments cannot definitively measure stratospheric CH4 to sufficient accuracy to eliminate these biases. Applying transport diagnostics to the models indicates that model-to-model differences in the simulation of stratospheric transport, notably the age of stratospheric air, can largely explain the inter-model spread in stratospheric CH4 and, hence, its contribution to XCH4. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to analyze how individual model components (e.g., physical parameterization, meteorological data sets, model horizontal/vertical resolution) impact the simulation of stratospheric CH4 and XCH4.		1

The scheme was included in a global atmospheric model and used to quantify the stratospheric injection of chlorine from anthropogenic VSLS ( math formula) between 2005 and 2013. By constraining the model with surface measurements of chloroform (CHCl3), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), tetrachloroethene (C2Cl4), trichloroethene (C2HCl3), and 1,2-dichloroethane (CH2ClCH2Cl), we infer a 2013 math formula mixing ratio of 123 parts per trillion (ppt). Stratospheric injection of source gases dominates this supply, accounting for ∼83% of the total. The remainder comes from VSLS-derived organic products, phosgene (COCl2, 7%) and formyl chloride (CHClO, 2%), and also hydrogen chloride (HCl, 8%). Stratospheric math formula increased by ∼52% between 2005 and 2013, with a mean growth rate of 3.7 ppt Cl/yr. This increase is due to recent and ongoing growth in anthropogenic CH2Cl2—the most abundant chlorinated VSLS not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.		1

This instrument has a high spectral resolution (0.0625 cm−1) and a wide spectral coverage (from 685 to 2410 cm−1) that allow measuring and discriminating among the many bands originating the atmospheric 4.3 μm radiance. Also its high sensitivity allows measuring the atmospheric limb emission in a wide altitude range, from 20 to 170 km in its middle and upper atmosphere modes, and hence obtain information on the temperature dependence of the collisional rates. In particular, we retrieve the rate coefficients and their temperature dependence in the 130–250 K range of the following processes: math formula with vd=2v1+v2=2,3, and 4; math formula with math formula and Δl = 0; and with Δvd=0 and Δl ≠ 0. In addition we have also retrieved the thermal relaxation of CO2(v3) into the v1 and v2 modes, e.g., math formula with Δvd=2–4 and Δv3=−1 and the efficiency of the excitation of N2(1) by O(1D). All of them were retrieved with a much better accuracy than were known before. The new rates have very important effects on the atmospheric limb radiance in the 10, 4.3 and 2.7 μm spectral regions (5–8% at 4.3 μm) and allow a more accurate inversion of the CO2 volume mixing ratio in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere from measurements taken in those spectral regions.		1

The data set has dynamical fields that are very close to the reanalysis below 1 hPa and chemical tracers that are self-consistent with respect to the model winds and temperature. The chemical tracers are expected to be close to actual observations. The data set is here compared to two satellite records – the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer and the Odin Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System – for the purpose of validating the temperature, ozone, water vapour and methane fields. Data from the Aura microwave limb sounder are also used for validation of the chemical processing in the polar vortex. It is found that the CMAM30 temperature is warmer by up to 5 K in the stratosphere, with a low bias in the mesosphere of ~ 5–15 K. Ozone is reasonable (±15 %), except near the tropopause globally and in the Southern Hemisphere winter polar vortex. Water vapour is consistently low by 10–20 %, with corresponding high methane of 10–20 %, except in the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex. Discrepancies in this region are shown to stem from the treatment of polar stratospheric cloud formation in the model.		1

A prerequisite before combining data is the examination of differences and drifts between the data sets. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of ozone profile differences based on pairwise collocated measurements, including the evolution of the differences with time. Such a diagnosis is helpful to identify strengths and weaknesses of each data set that may vary in time and introduce uncertainties in long-term trend estimates. The analysis reveals that the relative drift between the sensors is not statistically significant for most pairs of instruments. The relative drift values can be used to estimate the added uncertainty in physical trends. The added drift uncertainty is estimated at about 3 % decade−1 (1σ). Larger differences and variability in the differences are found in the lowermost stratosphere (below 20 km) and in the mesosphere.		1

This caused NOx enhancements in the polar upper stratosphere in April 2004 that were unprecedented in the satellite record. Simulations of the 2003–2004 Arctic winter with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model using Specified Dynamics (SD-WACCM) are compared to satellite measurements to assess our understanding of the observed NOx enhancements. The comparisons show that SD-WACCM clearly displays the descent of NOx produced by EPP but underestimates the enhancements by at least a factor of four. Comparisons with NO measurements in January and February indicate that SD-WACCM most likely underestimates EPP-induced NO production locally in the mesosphere because it does not include precipitation of high energy electrons. Comparisons with temperature measurements suggest that SD-WACCM does not properly simulate recovery from a sudden stratospheric warming in early January, resulting in insufficient transport from the MLT into the stratosphere. Both of these factors probably contribute to the inability of SD-WACCM to simulate the stratospheric NOx enhancements, although their relative importance is unclear. The work highlights the importance of considering the full spectrum of precipitating electrons in order to fully understand the impact of EPP on the atmosphere. It also suggests a need for high-quality meteorological data and measurements of NOx throughout the polar winter MLT.		1

The kinetic temperatures and CO2 volume mixing ratios (VMRs) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have been simultaneously retrieved using SABER limb radiances at 15 and 4.3 µm under nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. This paper presents results of a validation study of the SABER CO2 VMRs obtained with a two-channel, self-consistent temperature/CO2 retrieval algorithm. Results are based on comparisons with coincident CO2 measurements made by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and simulations using the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). The SABER CO2 VMRs are in agreement with ACE-FTS observations within reported systematic uncertainties from 65 to 110 km. The annual average SABER CO2 VMR falls off from a well-mixed value above ~80 km. Latitudinal and seasonal variations of CO2 VMRs are substantial. SABER observations and the SD-WACCM simulations are in overall agreement for CO2 seasonal variations, as well as global distributions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Not surprisingly, the CO2 seasonal variation is shown to be driven by the general circulation, converging in the summer polar mesopause region and diverging in the winter polar mesopause region.		1

Stratospheric tracers, O3, HNO3, and HCl, have lower mixing ratios ∼2–8 km above the primary (lowermost) tropopause in DT than in ST regions in all seasons, with maximum Northern Hemisphere (NH) differences near 50% in winter and 30% in summer. Southern Hemisphere winter differences are somewhat smaller, but summer differences are similar in the two hemispheres. H2O in DT regions of both hemispheres shows strong negative anomalies in November through February and positive anomalies in July through October, reflecting the strong seasonal cycle in H2O near the tropical tropopause. CO and other tropospheric tracers examined have higher DT than ST values 2–7 km above the primary tropopause, with the largest differences in winter. Large DT-ST differences extend to high NH latitudes in fall and winter, with longitudinal maxima in regions associated with enhanced wave activity and subtropical jet variations. Results for O3 and HNO3 agree closely between MLS and HIRDLS, and differences from ACE-FTS are consistent with its sparse and irregular midlatitude sampling. Consistent signatures in climatological trace gas fields provide strong evidence that transport from the tropical upper troposphere into the layer between double tropopauses is an important pathway for stratosphere-troposphere exchange.		1

Since February 2004, high resolution (0.02 cm−1) observations in the spectral region of 750–4400 cm−1 have been used to derive volume mixing ratio profiles of over 30 atmospheric trace species and over 20 atmospheric isotopologues. Although the full ACE-FTS level 2 data set is available to users in the general atmospheric community, until now no quality flags have been assigned to the data. This study describes the two-stage procedure for detecting physically unrealistic outliers within the data set for each retrieved species, which is a fixed procedure across all species. Since the distributions of ACE-FTS data across regions (altitude/latitude/season/local time) tend to be asymmetric and multimodal, the screening process does not make use of the median absolute deviation. It makes use of volume mixing ratio probability density functions, assuming that the data, when sufficiently binned, are at most tri-modal and that these modes can be represented by the superposition of three normal, or log-normal, distributions. Quality flags have been assigned to the data based on retrieval statistical fitting error, the physically unrealistic outliers described in this study, and known instrumental/processing errors. The quality flags defined and discussed in this study are now available for all level 2 versions 2.5 and 3.5 data and will be made available as a standard product for future versions.		1

We find that total ozone depletion in both hemispheres is dependent on cold temperatures (below 192 K) and associated heterogeneous chemistry on polar stratospheric cloud particles. Reactions limited to warmer temperatures above 192 K, or on binary liquid aerosols, yield little modeled polar ozone depletion in either hemisphere. An imposed factor of three enhancement in stratospheric sulfate increases ozone loss by up to 20 Dobson unit (DU) in the Antarctic and 15 DU in the Arctic in this model. Such enhanced sulfate loads are similar to those observed following recent relatively small volcanic eruptions since 2005 and imply impacts on the search for polar ozone recovery. Ozone losses are strongly sensitive to temperature, with a test case cooler by 2 K producing as much as 30 DU additional ozone loss in the Antarctic and 40 DU in the Arctic. A new finding of this paper is the use of the temporal behavior and variability of ClONO2 and HCl as indicators of the efficacy of heterogeneous chemistry. Transport of ClONO2 from the southern subpolar regions near 55–65°S to higher latitudes near 65–75°S provides a flux of NOx from more sunlit latitudes to the edge of the vortex and is important for ozone loss in this model. Comparisons between modeled and observed total column and profile ozone perturbations, ClONO2 abundances, and the rate of change of HCl bolster confidence in these conclusions.		1

Water vapor measurements from Earth Observing System-Microwave Limb Sounder and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer over North America are binned according to the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project deep convection indices. The results show that in the North American region (50–112°W, 10–50°N) the convection-impacted samples are significantly moister than the nonimpact samples in the lowermost stratospheric layer right above the tropopause, and a drier tendency is also noticed right above this moistened layer. Trajectory modeling is used to aid the identification of deep convection-impacted water vapor samples. However, we find that a substantial fraction of high-concentration (>8 ppmv) samples at 100 hPa cannot be attributed to nearby deep convections.		1

We simulate this event with the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS), both with optimized mixing parameters and with no mixing, i.e. with transport occurring only along the Lagrangian trajectories. The results are investigated by using tracer–tracer correlations and by applying the transformed Eulerian-mean formalism. The CLaMS simulation of N2O and O3, and in particular of the O3–N2O tracer correlations with optimized mixing parameters, shows good agreement with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data. The spatial distribution of mixing intensity in CLaMS correlates fairly well with the Eliassen–Palm flux convergence. This correlation illustrates how planetary waves drive mixing. By comparing simulations with and without mixing, we find that after the SSW, poleward transport of air increases, not only across the vortex edge but also across the subtropical transport barrier. Moreover, the SSW event, at the same time, accelerates polar descent and tropical ascent of the Brewer–Dobson circulation. The accelerated ascent in the tropics and descent at high latitudes first occurs in the upper stratosphere and then propagates downward to the lower stratosphere. This downward propagation takes over 1 month from the potential temperature level of 1000 to 400 K.		1

This paper presents an overview of the methods, assumptions, and challenges involved in constructing such merged data sets, as well as the first thorough intercomparison of seven new long-term satellite data sets. The analysis focuses on the representation of the annual cycle, interannual variability, and long-term trends for the period 1984–2011, which is common to all data sets. Overall, the best agreement amongst data sets is seen in the mid-latitude lower and middle stratosphere, with larger differences in the equatorial lower stratosphere and the upper stratosphere globally. In most cases, differences in the choice of underlying instrument records that were merged produced larger differences between data sets than the use of different merging techniques. Long-term ozone trends were calculated for the period 1984–2011 using a piecewise linear regression with a change in trend prescribed at the end of 1997. For the 1984–1997 period, trends tend to be most similar between data sets (with largest negative trends ranging from −4 to −8% decade−1 in the mid-latitude upper stratosphere), in large part due to the fact that most data sets are predominantly (or only) based on the SAGE-II record. Trends in the middle and lower stratosphere are much smaller, and, particularly for the lower stratosphere, large uncertainties remain. For the later period (1998–2011), trends vary to a greater extent, ranging from approximately −1 to +5% decade−1 in the upper stratosphere. Again, middle and lower stratospheric trends are smaller and for most data sets not significantly different from zero. Overall, however, there is a clear shift from mostly negative to mostly positive trends between the two periods over much of the profile.		1

Over the past few decades observations from aircraft campaigns and surface sites have been used to better understand the regional distribution of PAN. However, recent measurements made by satellites allow for a global assessment of PAN in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS). In this study, we investigate global PAN distributions from two independent retrieval methodologies, based on measurements from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instrument, on board Envisat from the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester (UoL). Retrieving PAN from MIPAS is challenging due to the weak signal in the measurements and contamination from other species. Therefore, we compare the two MIPAS datasets with observations from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS), in situ aircraft data and the 3-D chemical transport model TOMCAT. MIPAS shows peak UTLS PAN concentrations over the biomass burning regions (e.g. ranging from 150 to  >  200 pptv at 150 hPa) and during the summertime Asian monsoon as enhanced convection aids the vertical transport of PAN from the lower atmosphere. At 150 hPa, we find significant differences between the two MIPAS datasets in the tropics, where IMK PAN concentrations are larger by 50–100 pptv. Comparisons between MIPAS and ACE-FTS show better agreement with the UoL MIPAS PAN concentrations at 200 hPa, but with mixed results above this altitude. TOMCAT generally captures the magnitude and structure of climatological aircraft PAN profiles within the observational variability allowing it to be used to investigate the MIPAS PAN differences. TOMCAT–MIPAS comparisons show that the model is both positively (UoL) and negatively (IMK) biased against the satellite products. These results indicate that satellite PAN observations are able to detect realistic spatial variations in PAN in the UTLS, but further work is needed to resolve differences in existing retrievals to allow quantitative use of the products.		1

The CO2 data show a trend of ~5% per decade at ~80 km and below, in good agreement with the tropospheric trend observed at Mauna Loa. Above 80 km, the SABER CO2 trend is larger than in the lower atmosphere, reaching ~12% per decade at 110 km. The large relative trend in the upper atmosphere is consistent with results from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). On the other hand, the CO2 trend deduced from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model remains close to 5% everywhere. The spatial coverage of the SABER instrument allows us to analyze the CO2 trend as a function of latitude for the first time. The trend is larger in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere mesopause above 80 km. The agreement between SABER and ACE-FTS suggests that the rate of increase of CO2 in the upper atmosphere over the past 13 years is considerably larger than can be explained by chemistry-climate models.		1

These observations have been compared to predictions from WACCM (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model). The highest positive fractionation (i.e. relatively more 13CO) values of over 100‰ are observed in the lower thermosphere during winter in both hemispheres, whereas the highest negative fractionation (i.e. relatively more 12CO) is observed in the mesosphere in the summer at high latitudes (due to the highly fractionating effect that UV light has on CO2) and year round in the tropics. Agreement between measurements and model results is generally good at high altitude, although ACE shows a stronger fractionation effect from CO2 photolysis than predicted by WACCM. In the lower atmosphere, agreement is qualitatively good, although there is a distinct discrepancy at 40 km in all seasons, which is likely a retrieval artifact.		1

Additionally, atmospheric methane chemistry is modeled using the Whole Atmospheric Community Climate Model (WACCM). ACE retrievals of methane extend from 6 km for all isotopologues to 75 km for 12CH4, 35 km for CH3D, and 50 km for 13CH4. While total methane concentrations retrieved from ACE agree well with the model, values of δD–CH4 and δ13C–CH4 show a bias toward higher δ compared to the model and balloon-based measurements. Errors in spectroscopic constants used during the retrieval process are the primary source of this disagreement. Calibrating δD and δ13C from ACE using WACCM in the troposphere gives improved agreement in δD in the stratosphere with the balloon measurements, but values of δ13C still disagree. A model analysis of methane's atmospheric sinks is also performed.		1

The MLS HNO3 product has been greatly improved over that in the previous version (v1.5), with smoother profiles, much more realistic behavior at the lowest retrieval levels, and correction of a high bias caused by an error in one of the spectroscopy files used in v1.5 processing. The v2.2 HNO3 data are scientifically useful over the range 215 to 3.2 hPa, with single-profile precision of ∼0.7 ppbv throughout. Vertical resolution is 3–4 km in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, degrading to ∼5 km in the middle and upper stratosphere. The impact of various sources of systematic uncertainty has been quantified through a comprehensive set of retrieval simulations. In aggregate, systematic uncertainties are estimated to induce in the v2.2 HNO3 measurements biases that vary with altitude between ±0.5 and ±2 ppbv and multiplicative errors of ±5–15% throughout the stratosphere, rising to ∼±30% at 215 hPa. Consistent with this uncertainty analysis, comparisons with correlative data sets show that relative to HNO3 measurements from ground-based, balloon-borne, and satellite instruments operating in both the infrared and microwave regions of the spectrum, MLS v2.2 HNO3 mixing ratios are uniformly low by 10–30% throughout most of the stratosphere. Comparisons with in situ measurements made from the DC-8 and WB-57 aircraft in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere indicate that the MLS HNO3 values are low in this region as well, but are useful for scientific studies (with appropriate averaging).		1

A. Walker, S. Conway, N. Saitoh, C. D. Boone, K. Strong, and J. R. Drummond	2016	5	Atmospheric Measurement Techniques				9	5	1961-1980			https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/9/1961/2016/		publications/pdfs/amt-9-1961-2016.pdf			10.5194/amt-9-1961-2016	f	We present cross-validation of remote sensing measurements of methane profiles in the Canadian high Arctic. Accurate and precise measurements of methane are essential to understand quantitatively its role in the climate system and in global change. Here, we show a cross-validation between three data sets: two from spaceborne instruments and one from a ground-based instrument. All are Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs). We consider the Canadian SCISAT Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE)-FTS, a solar occultation infrared spectrometer operating since 2004, and the thermal infrared band of the Japanese Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation (TANSO)-FTS, a nadir/off-nadir scanning FTS instrument operating at solar and terrestrial infrared wavelengths, since 2009. The ground-based instrument is a Bruker 125HR Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, measuring mid-infrared solar absorption spectra at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) Ridge Laboratory at Eureka, Nunavut (80° N, 86° W) since 2006. For each pair of instruments, measurements are collocated within 500 km and 24 h. An additional collocation criterion based on potential vorticity values was found not to significantly affect differences between measurements. Profiles are regridded to a common vertical grid for each comparison set. To account for differing vertical resolutions, ACE-FTS measurements are smoothed to the resolution of either PEARL-FTS or TANSO-FTS, and PEARL-FTS measurements are smoothed to the TANSO-FTS resolution. Differences for each pair are examined in terms of profile and partial columns. During the period considered, the number of collocations for each pair is large enough to obtain a good sample size (from several hundred to tens of thousands depending on pair and configuration). Considering full profiles, the degrees of freedom for signal (DOFS) are between 0.2 and 0.7 for TANSO-FTS and between 1.5 and 3 for PEARL-FTS, while ACE-FTS has considerably more information (roughly 1 DOFS per altitude level). We take partial columns between roughly 5 and 30 km for the ACE-FTS–PEARL-FTS comparison, and between 5 and 10 km for the other pairs. The DOFS for the partial columns are between 1.2 and 2 for PEARL-FTS collocated with ACE-FTS, between 0.1 and 0.5 for PEARL-FTS collocated with TANSO-FTS or for TANSO-FTS collocated with either other instrument, while ACE-FTS has much higher information content. For all pairs, the partial column differences are within ±3 × 1022 molecules cm−2. Expressed as median ± median absolute deviation (expressed in partial column units or as a percentage), these differences are 0.11 ± 9.60  × 1020 molecules cm−2 (0.012 ± 1.018 %) for TANSO-FTS–PEARL-FTS, −2.6 ± 2.6 × 1021  cm−2 (−1.6 ± 1.6 %) for ACE-FTS–PEARL-FTS, and 7.4 ± 6.0 × 1020 molecules cm−2 (0.78 ± 0.64 %) for TANSO-FTS–ACE-FTS. The differences for ACE-FTS–PEARL-FTS and TANSO-FTS–PEARL-FTS partial columns decrease significantly as a function of PEARL partial columns, whereas the range of partial column values for TANSO-FTS–ACE-FTS collocations is too small to draw any conclusion on its dependence on ACE-FTS partial columns.		1

The acetone profiles retrieved from 5 to ∼20 km cover the period from January 2004 to September 2010. The 1σ statistical fitting errors are typically ∼5–20% within the upper troposphere (UT), increasing in the lower stratosphere (LS) with decreasing acetone. The systematic errors range between 15% and 20%. The largest UT acetone mixing ratios (∼1200 ppt on average in July over Siberia) are observed in summer in the northern mid- and high latitudes. Mixing ratios are larger over continental regions than over the ocean. Comparisons with airborne measurements available in the literature point toward a possible underestimation in acetone retrieved from ACE-FTS. The largest differences occur primarily in winter and for the background values. This underestimation is attributed to the complexity of the spectral region used for the retrieval. The annual cycle of acetone for the 30–70°N midlatitude band shows a maximum during summer, reflecting the annual cycle of the primary terrestrial biogenic source of acetone. By comparison with ACE-FTS, the LMDz-INCA global climate-chemistry model systematically overestimates acetone mixing ratios lower than 400 ppt. This overestimation is thus generalized for the lower stratosphere, the Tropics and beyond 70°N for the upper troposphere. In contrast, in the upper troposphere of the 30–70°N region, where the acetone levels are the highest (>450 ppt on average), the model-observation differences are in the range of the observation uncertainty. However, in this region, the model fails to capture the annual cycle of acetone, culminating in July. A seasonal cycle can only be obtained by considering high biogenic emissions but this cycle is shifted toward autumn, likely indicating an underestimation of the chemical destruction in the northern high latitudes.		1

Temporal variability in the total column of CH4 due to stratospheric dynamics obscures fluctuations and trends driven by tropospheric transport and local surface fluxes that are critical for understanding CH4 sources and sinks. We reduce the contribution of stratospheric variability from the total column average by subtracting an estimate of the stratospheric CH4 derived from simultaneous measurements of hydrogen fluoride (HF). HF provides a proxy for stratospheric CH4 because it is strongly correlated to CH4 in the stratosphere, has an accurately known tropospheric abundance (of zero), and is measured at most TCCON stations. The stratospheric partial column of CH4 is calculated as a function of the zonal and annual trends in the relationship between CH4 and HF in the stratosphere, which we determine from ACE-FTS satellite data. We also explicitly take into account the CH4 column averaging kernel to estimate the contribution of stratospheric CH4 to the total column. The resulting tropospheric CH4 columns are consistent with in situ aircraft measurements and augment existing observations in the troposphere.		1

The estimated trend (~9% per decade) is about a factor of 2 larger than the rate of increase that can be ascribed to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 (~5% per decade). Here we investigate whether the observed trends of CO2 and COx can be reproduced using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), a comprehensive global model with interactive chemistry, wherein vertical eddy diffusion is estimated from a parameterization of gravity wave breaking that can respond to changes in the model climate. We find that the modeled trends of CO2 and COx do not differ significantly at any altitude from the value expected from anthropogenic increases of CO2 and that WACCM does not produce significant changes in eddy diffusivity. We show that the discrepancy between model and observations cannot be attributed to uncertainties associated with geophysical noise and instrumental effects, to difficulties separating a linear trend from the 11 year solar signal, or to sparse sampling by ACE-FTS. Estimates of the impact of vertical diffusion on CO2 in the model indicate that a large increase in Kzz (~30% per decade) would be necessary to reconcile WACCM results with observations. It might be possible to ascertain whether such a large change in vertical mixing has in fact taken place by examining the trend of water vapor in the upper mesosphere.		1

Many of these fluorine-containing species deplete stratospheric ozone and are regulated by the Montreal Protocol. Once in the atmosphere they slowly degrade, ultimately leading to the formation of hydrogen fluoride (HF), the dominant reservoir of stratospheric fluorine due to its extreme stability. Monitoring the growth of stratospheric HF is therefore an important marker for the success of the Montreal Protocol.\r\n\r\nWe report the comparison of global distributions and trends of HF measured in the Earth's atmosphere by the satellite remote-sensing instruments ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer), which has been recording atmospheric spectra since 2004, and HALOE (HALogen Occultation Experiment), which recorded atmospheric spectra between 1991 and 2005, with the output of SLIMCAT, a state-of-the-art three-dimensional chemical transport model. In general the agreement between observation and model is good, although the ACE-FTS measurements are biased high by  ∼  10 % relative to HALOE. The observed global HF trends reveal a substantial slowing down in the rate of increase of HF since the 1990s: 4.97 ± 0.12 % year−1 (1991–1997; HALOE), 1.12 ± 0.08 % year−1 (1998–2005; HALOE), and 0.52 ± 0.03 % year−1 (2004–2012; ACE-FTS). In comparison, SLIMCAT calculates trends of 4.01, 1.10, and 0.48 % year−1, respectively, for the same periods; the agreement is very good for all but the earlier of the two HALOE periods. Furthermore, the observations reveal variations in the HF trends with latitude and altitude; for example, between 2004 and 2012 HF actually decreased in the Southern Hemisphere below  ∼  35 km. An additional SLIMCAT simulation with repeating meteorology for the year 2000 produces much cleaner trends in HF with minimal variations with latitude and altitude. Therefore, the variations with latitude and altitude in the observed HF trends are due to variability in stratospheric dynamics on the timescale of a few years. Overall, the agreement between observation and model points towards the ongoing success of the Montreal Protocol and the usefulness of HF as a metric for stratospheric fluorine.		1

In fact, during the two Arctic winters 2009/10 and 2010/11 the strongest denitrification in the recent decade was observed. Sensitivity studies along air parcel trajectories are performed to test how a future stratospheric water vapour (H2O) increase of 1 ppmv or a temperature decrease of 1 K would affect PSC formation. We perform our study based on measurements made during the Arctic winter 2010/11. Air parcel trajectories were calculated 6 days backward in time based on PSCs detected by CALIPSO (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder satellite observations). The sensitivity study was performed on single trajectories as well as on a trajectory ensemble. The sensitivity study shows a clear prolongation of the potential for PSC formation and PSC existence when the temperature in the stratosphere is decreased by 1 K and water vapour is increased by 1 ppmv. Based on 15 years of satellite measurements (2000–2014) from UARS/HALOE, Envisat/MIPAS, Odin/SMR, Aura/MLS, Envisat/SCIAMACHY and SCISAT/ACE-FTS it is further investigated if there is a decrease in temperature and/or increase of water vapour (H2O) observed in the polar regions similar to that observed at midlatitudes and in the tropics. Performing linear regression analyses we derive from the Envisat/MIPAS (2002–2012) and Aura/MLS (2004–2014) observations predominantly positive changes in the potential temperature range 350 to 1000 K. The linear changes in water vapour derived from Envisat/MIPAS observations are largely insignificant, while those from Aura/MLS are mostly significant. For the temperature neither of the two instruments indicate any significant changes. Given the strong inter-annual variation observed in water vapour and particular temperature the severe denitrification observed in 2010/11 cannot be directly related to any changes in water vapour and temperature since the millennium. However, the observations indicate a clear correlation between cold winters and enhanced water vapour mixing ratios. This indicates a connection between dynamical and radiative processes that govern water vapour and temperature in the Arctic lower stratosphere.		1

In the calculation of XCH4 from aircraft measurements (aircraft-based XCH4), other satellite data were used for the CH4 profiles above the tropopause. We proposed a data-screening scheme for aircraft-based XCH4 for reliable validation of GOSAT XCH4. Further, we examined the impact of GOSAT SWIR column averaging kernels (CAK) on the aircraft-based XCH4 calculation and found that the difference between aircraft-based XCH4 with and without the application of the GOSAT CAK was less than ±9 ppb at maximum, with an average difference of −0.5 ppb. \r\n\r\nWe compared GOSAT XCH4 Ver. 02.00 data retrieved within ±2° or ±5° latitude–longitude boxes centered at each aircraft measurement site with aircraft-based XCH4 measured on a GOSAT overpass day. In general, GOSAT XCH4 was in good agreement with aircraft-based XCH4. However, over land, the GOSAT data showed a positive bias of 1.5 ppb (2.0 ppb) with a standard deviation of 14.9 ppb (16.0 ppb) within the ±2° (±5°) boxes, and over ocean, the average bias was 4.1 ppb (6.5 ppb) with a standard deviation of 9.4 ppb (8.8 ppb) within the ±2° (±5°) boxes. In addition, we obtained similar results when we used an aircraft-based XCH4 time series obtained by curve fitting with temporal interpolation for comparison with GOSAT data.		1

The climatologies in the form of monthly zonal mean time series are obtained from HALOE, MIPAS, ACE-FTS, and HIRDLS within the time period 1991–2010. The intercomparisons focus on the mean biases of the monthly and annual zonal mean fields and aim to identify their vertical, latitudinal and temporal structure. The CFC evaluations (based on MIPAS, ACE-FTS and HIRDLS) reveal that the uncertainty in our knowledge of the atmospheric CFC-11 and CFC-12 mean state, as given by satellite data sets, is smallest in the tropics and mid-latitudes at altitudes below 50 and 20 hPa, respectively, with a 1σ multi-instrument spread of up to ±5 %. For HF, the situation is reversed. The two available data sets (HALOE and ACE-FTS) agree well above 100 hPa, with a spread in this region of ±5 to ±10 %, while at altitudes below 100 hPa the HF annual mean state is less well known, with a spread ±30 % and larger. The atmospheric SF6 annual mean states derived from two satellite data sets (MIPAS and ACE-FTS) show only very small differences with a spread of less than ±5 % and often below ±2.5 %. While the overall agreement among the climatological data sets is very good for large parts of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (CFCs, SF6) or middle stratosphere (HF), individual discrepancies have been identified. Pronounced deviations between the instrument climatologies exist for particular atmospheric regions which differ from gas to gas. Notable features are differently shaped isopleths in the subtropics, deviations in the vertical gradients in the lower stratosphere and in the meridional gradients in the upper troposphere, and inconsistencies in the seasonal cycle. Additionally, long-term drifts between the instruments have been identified for the CFC-11 and CFC-12 time series. The evaluations as a whole provide guidance on what data sets are the most reliable for applications such as studies of atmospheric transport and variability, model–measurement comparisons and detection of long-term trends. The data sets will be publicly available from the SPARC Data Centre and through PANGAEA (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.849223).		1

This work presents the retrieval and the characterization of ground-based CO measurements from the winters 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 by the Kiruna microwave radiometer KIMRA, located in northern Sweden (67.8° N, 20.4° E). Furthermore, the dataset is used for an extensive comparison to the recent satellite instruments MLS on Aura, ACE-FTS, and MIPAS on Envisat. \r\n\r\nThe vmr profiles are retrieved using the optimal estimation approach. A detailed analysis of the averaging kernel functions is carried out, showing sensitivity of the measurements between 40 and 80 km altitude, a vertical resolution of 16 to 22 km, as well as a residual influence of the region up to 130 km altitude. An error assessment reveals a total error of the retrieved profile that increases with altitude and is approx. ±0.1 ppmv at 50 km altitude and ±3 ppmv at 80 km altitude. The main contributions to this total error arise from the measurement noise and the uncertainty of the used temperature profiles. The expected dynamical features of the polar winter middle atmosphere are qualitatively identified in the retrieved time series, but are not quantitatively analyzed here. \r\n\r\nThe dense MLS dataset is used to investigate the influence of the collocation criteria on the satellite comparison, showing that relaxing the distance criterion causes a high bias for MLS. The comparison including the other instruments is difficult because of the small number of coincidences. However, it suggests that there is a general agreement between KIMRA and the satellite instruments below 65 km altitude, but a high bias for KIMRA above this altitude. Furthermore, the shape of the KIMRA profile appears to be systematically different from the satellite profiles.		1

The retrieval is performed using a method called onion peeling DOAS (ONPD), which combines an onion peeling approach with a weighting function DOAS (differential optical absorption spectroscopy) fit in the spectral region between 1559 and 1671 nm. By use of updated pointing information and optimisation of the data selection as well as of the retrieval approach, the altitude range for reasonable CH4 could be broadened from 20 to 40 km to about 17 to 45 km. Furthermore, the quality of the derived CO2 has been assessed such that now the first stratospheric profiles (17–45 km) of CO2 from SCIAMACHY are available. Comparisons with independent data sets yield an estimated accuracy of the new SCIAMACHY stratospheric profiles of about 5–10 % for CH4 and 2–3 % for CO2. The accuracy of the products is currently mainly restricted by the appearance of unexpected vertical oscillations in the derived profiles which need further investigation. Using the improved ONPD retrieval, CH4 and CO2 stratospheric data sets covering the whole SCIAMACHY time series (August 2002–April 2012) and the latitudinal range between about 50 and 70° N have been derived. Based on these time series, CH4 and CO2 trends have been estimated. CH4 trends above about 20 km are not significantly different from zero and the trend at 17 km is about 3 ppbv year−1. The derived CO2 trends show a general decrease with altitude with values of about 1.9 ppmv year−1 at 21 km and about 1.3 ppmv year−1 at 39 km. These results are in reasonable agreement with total column trends for these gases. This shows that the new SCIAMACHY data sets can provide valuable information about the stratosphere.		1

This technique benefits from a long optical path length and high signal strength, and can have high spectral resolution. The Martian atmosphere is often subject to large quantities of suspended dust, which attenuates solar radiation along the line-of-sight. An instrument making solar occultation measurements scans the limb of the atmosphere continuously, and the optical path moves through layers of increasing or decreasing dust levels during a single interferogram acquisition, resulting in time-varying signal intensity. If uncorrected, source intensity variations (SIVs) can affect the relative depth of absorption lines, negatively impacting trace gas retrievals. We have simulated SIVs using synthetic spectra for the Martian atmosphere, and investigated different techniques to mitigate the effects of SIVs. We examined high-pass filters in the wavenumber domain, and smoothing methods in the optical path difference (OPD) domain, and conclude that using a convolution operator in the OPD domain can isolate the SIVs and be used to correct for it. We observe spectral residuals of less than 0.25% in both high- and low-dust conditions, and retrieved volume mixing ratio vertical profile differences on the order of 0.5–3% for several trace gases known to be present in the Martian atmosphere. These differences are smaller than those caused by adding realistic noise to the spectra. This work thus demonstrates that it should be possible to retrieve vertical profiles of trace gases in a dusty Martian atmosphere using solar occultation if the interferograms are corrected for the effects of dust.		1

Total columns and temporal variabilities of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ethane (C2H6) as well as the first derived total columns at Eureka of acetylene (C2H2), methanol (CH3OH), formic acid (HCOOH) and formaldehyde (H2CO) are investigated, providing a new data set in the sparsely sampled high latitudes. \r\n\r\nTotal columns are obtained using the SFIT2 retrieval algorithm based on the optimal estimation method. The microwindows as well as the a priori profiles and variabilities are selected to optimize the information content of the retrievals, and error analyses are performed for all seven species. Our retrievals show good sensitivities in the troposphere. The seasonal amplitudes of the time series, ranging from 34 to 104%, are captured while using a single a priori profile for each species. The time series of the CO, C2H6 and C2H2 total columns at PEARL exhibit strong seasonal cycles with maxima in winter and minima in summer, in opposite phase to the HCN, CH3OH, HCOOH and H2CO time series. These cycles result from the relative contributions of the photochemistry, oxidation and transport as well as biogenic and biomass burning emissions. \r\n\r\nComparisons of the FTIR partial columns with coincident satellite measurements by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) show good agreement. The correlation coefficients and the slopes range from 0.56 to 0.97 and 0.50 to 3.35, respectively, for the seven target species. \r\n\r\nOur new data set is compared to previous measurements found in the literature to assess atmospheric budgets of these tropospheric species in the high Arctic. The CO and C2H6concentrations are consistent with negative trends observed over the Northern Hemisphere, attributed to fossil fuel emission decrease. The importance of poleward transport for the atmospheric budgets of HCN and C2H2 is highlighted. Columns and variabilities of CH3OH and HCOOH at PEARL are comparable to previous measurements performed at other remote sites. However, the small columns of H2CO in early May might reflect its large atmospheric variability and/or the effect of the updated spectroscopic parameters used in our retrievals. Overall, emissions from biomass burning contribute to the day-to-day variabilities of the seven tropospheric species observed at Eureka.		1

The version of the TLP model we use includes the simulation of long-lived trace gases, such as SF6 and CO2, as well as photochemically active trace gases such as CFC-11, CFC-12, and N2O. The TLP model was found to accurately replicate trace gas output from the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) for time-averaged profiles in the tropics and each extratropical region. Given confidence that the TLP model represents the basic transport features in CMAM we then used the TLP model to interpret differences between CMAM output and measurements from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment and balloons. The TLP model is shown to uniquely determine residual mean circulation and recirculation (mixing between the extratropics and tropics) changes necessary for CMAM to more accurately simulate the measurements. Such guidance on these transport parameters is novel due to the relatively high precision and the simultaneous derivation of important parameters, as compared to previous studies. The TLP model can ideally be used as a bridge between measurements and CCMs to potentially allow more targeted modification of the CCMs than would otherwise be possible.		1

P., Wilson, C., Gerbig, and C.	2016	10	Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions				\N	\N	1-32		CH4, 13CH4, CH3D			publications/pdfs/acp-2016-704.pdf			10.5194/acp-2016-704	f	Airborne observations of greenhouse gases are a very useful reference for validation of satellite-based columnaveraged\r\ndry air mole fraction data. However, since the aircraft data are available only up to about 9-13 km altitude, these\r\nprofiles do not fully represent the depth of the atmosphere observed by satellites and therefore need to be extended\r\nsynthetically into the stratosphere. In the near future, observations of CO2 and CH4 made from passenger aircraft are expected to be available through the In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) project. In this study, we\r\nanalyse three different data sources that are available for the stratospheric extension of aircraft profiles by comparing the\r\nerror introduced by each of them into the total column and provide recommendations regarding the best approach. First, we\r\nanalyse CH4 fields from two different models of atmospheric composition - the European Centre for Medium-Range\r\nWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System for Composition (C-IFS) and the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT 3-D chemical transport model. Secondly, we consider scenarios that simulate the effect of using CH4 climatologies such as those\r\nbased on balloons or satellite limb soundings. Thirdly, we assess the impact of using a-priori profiles used in the satellite\r\nretrievals for the stratospheric part of the total column. We find that the models considered in this study have a better\r\nestimation of the stratospheric CH4 as compared to the climatology-based data and the satellite a-priori profiles. Both the CIFS\r\nand TOMCAT models have a bias of about -9 ppb at the locations where tropospheric vertical profiles will be measured by IAGOS. The C-IFS model, however, has a lower random error (6.5 ppb) than TOMCAT (12.8 ppb). These values are\r\nwell within the minimum desired accuracy and precision of satellite total column XCH4 retrievals (10 ppb and 34 ppb,\r\nrespectively). In comparison, the a-priori profile from the University of Leicester Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite\r\n(GOSAT) Proxy XCH4 retrieval and climatology-based data introduce larger random errors in the total column, being\r\nlimited in spatial coverage and temporal variability. Furthermore, we find that the bias in the models varies with latitude and season. Therefore, applying appropriate bias correction to the model fields before using them for profile extension is\r\nexpected to further decrease the error contributed by the stratospheric part of the profile to the total column.		11

In contrast to Earth-observing instruments, which can rely on accurate meteorological models, a priori information, and spacecraft position, Mars retrievals require a method with minimal reliance on such data. The temperature and pressure retrieval algorithms developed for this work were evaluated using Earth-observing spectra from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) FTS, a solar occultation instrument in orbit since 2003, and the basis for the instrument selected for a Mars mission. ACE-FTS makes multiple measurements during an occultation, separated in altitude by 1.5–5 km, and we analyse 10 CO2 vibration–rotation bands at each altitude, each with a different usable altitude range. We describe the algorithms and present results of their application and their comparison to the ACE-FTS data products. The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) provides vertical profiles of temperature up to 40 km with high vertical resolution. Using six satellites and GPS radio occultation, COSMIC's data product has excellent temporal and spatial coverage, allowing us to find coincident measurements with ACE with very tight criteria: less than 1.5 h and 150 km. We present an intercomparison of temperature profiles retrieved from ACE-FTS using our algorithm, that of the ACE Science Team (v3.5), and from COSMIC. When our retrievals are compared to ACE-FTS v3.5, we find mean differences between −5 and +2 K and that our retrieved profiles have no seasonal or zonal biases but do have a warm bias in the stratosphere and a cold bias in the mesosphere. When compared to COSMIC, we do not observe a warm/cool bias and mean differences are between −4 and +1 K. COSMIC comparisons are restricted to below 40 km, where our retrievals have the best agreement with ACE-FTS v3.5. When comparing ACE-FTS v3.5 to COSMIC we observe a cold bias in COSMIC of 0.5 K, and mean differences are between −0.9 and +0.6 K.		1

All of the data analyzed have been collected from launches from a Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude site, during late summer, when stratospheric dynamic variability is at a minimum. The retrieval technique incorporates detailed forward modeling of the instrument and the radiative properties of the atmosphere, and obtains a best fit between modeled and measured spectra through a combination of onion-peeling and optimization steps. The retrieved HNO3 profiles are consistent over the 12-year period, and are consistent with recent measurements by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier transform spectrometer satellite instrument. We therefore find no evidence of long-term changes in the HNO3 summer mid-latitude profile, although the uncertainty of our measurements precludes a conclusive trend analysis.		1

The investigation is based on a multi-microwindow approach, two encompassing pairs of absorption lines belonging to the R-branch of the strong ν3 band of CF4 centered at 1283 cm−1, and two additional ones to optimally account for weak but overlapping HNO3 interferences. The analysis reveals a steady accumulation of the very long-lived CF4 above the Jungfraujoch at mean rates of (1.38 ± 0.11) × 1013 molec cm−2 yr−1 from 1989 to 1997, and (0.98 ± 0.02) × 1013 molec cm−2 yr−1 from 1998 to 2012, which correspond to linear growth rates of 1.71 ± 0.14 and 1.04 ± 0.02% yr−1 respectively referenced to 1989 and 1998. Related global CF4 anthropogenic emissions required to sustain these mean increases correspond to 15.8 ± 1.3 and 11.1 ± 0.2 Gg yr−1 over the above specified time intervals. Findings reported here are compared and discussed with respect to relevant northern mid-latitude results obtained remotely from space and balloons as well as in situ at the ground, including new gas chromatography mass spectrometry measurements performed at the Jungfraujoch since 2010.		1

Each was taking measurements between February 2004 and April 2012 (ACE-FTS and MLS are currently operational), providing hundreds of profile coincidences in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and during local morning and evening. Focusing on determining diurnal and hemispheric biases in the ACE-FTS data, this study compares ACE-FTS version 3.5 profiles that are collocated with MIPAS and MLS, and analyzes the differences between instrument retrievals for Northern and Southern hemispheres and for local morning and evening data. For O3, ACE-FTS is typically within ±5% of mid-stratospheric MIPAS and MLS data and exhibits a positive bias of ~10 to 20% in the upper stratosphere – lower mesosphere. For H2O, ACE-FTS exhibits an average bias of −5% between 20 and 60 km. For N2O, ACE-FTS agrees with MIPAS and MLS within −20 to +10% up to 45 km and 35 km, respectively. For HNO3, ACE-FTS typically agrees within ±10% below 30 km, and exhibits a positive bias of ~10 to 20% above 30 km. With respect to MIPAS CO, ACE-FTS exhibits an average −11% bias between 28 and 50 km, and at higher altitudes a positive bias on the order of 10% (>100%) in the winter (summer). With respect to winter MLS CO, ACE-FTS is typically within ±10% between 25 and 40 km, and has an average bias of −11% above 40 km.		1

Model fields are sampled using real sampling patterns from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), the HALogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). The MLS sampling acts as a proxy for a dense uniform sampling pattern typical of limb emission sounders, while HALOE and ACE-FTS represent coarse nonuniform sampling patterns characteristic of solar occultation instruments. First, this study revisits the impact of sampling patterns in terms of the sampling bias, as previous studies have done. Then, it quantifies the impact of different sampling patterns on the estimation of trends and their associated detectability. In general, we find that coarse nonuniform sampling patterns may introduce non-negligible errors in the inferred magnitude of temperature and trace gas trends and necessitate considerably longer records for their definitive detection. Lastly, we explore the impact of these sampling patterns on tropical vertical velocities derived from stratospheric water vapor measurements. We find that coarse nonuniform sampling may lead to a biased depiction of the tropical vertical velocities and, hence, to a biased estimation of the impact of the mechanisms that modulate these velocities. These case studies suggest that dense uniform sampling such as that available from limb emission sounders provides much greater fidelity in detecting signals of stratospheric change (for example, fingerprints of greenhouse gas warming and stratospheric ozone recovery) than coarse nonuniform sampling such as that of solar occultation instruments.		1

SCIAMACHY measured the scattered or direct sunlight using different observation geometries. The limb viewing geometry allows the retrieval of water vapour at about 10–25 km height from the near-infrared spectral range (1353–1410 nm). These data cover the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), a region in the atmosphere which is of special interest for a variety of dynamical and chemical processes as well as for the radiative forcing. Here, the latest data version of water vapour (V3.01) from SCIAMACHY limb measurements is presented and validated by comparisons with data sets from other satellite and in situ measurements. Considering retrieval tests and the results of these comparisons, the V3.01 data are reliable from about 11 to 23 km and the best results are found in the middle of the profiles between about 14 and 20 km. Above 20 km in the extra tropics V3.01 is drier than all other data sets. Additionally, for altitudes above about 19 km, the vertical resolution of the retrieved profile is not sufficient to resolve signals with a short vertical structure like the tape recorder. Below 14 km, SCIAMACHY water vapour V3.01 is wetter than most collocated data sets, but the high variability of water vapour in the troposphere complicates the comparison. For 14–20 km height, the expected errors from the retrieval and simulations and the mean differences to collocated data sets are usually smaller than 10 % when the resolution of the SCIAMACHY data is taken into account. In general, the temporal changes agree well with collocated data sets except for the Northern Hemisphere extratropical stratosphere, where larger differences are observed. This indicates a possible drift in V3.01 most probably caused by the incomplete treatment of volcanic aerosols in the retrieval. In all other regions a good temporal stability is shown. In the tropical stratosphere an increase in water vapour is found between 2002 and 2012, which is in agreement with other satellite data sets for overlapping time periods.		1

Zehner	2016	9	Atmospheric Measurement Techniques		Copernicus Publications		9	9	4701-4718		aerosols	http://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/9/4701/2016/		publications/pdfs/amt-9-4701-2016.pdf			10.5194/amt-9-4701-2016	f	AerGOM is a retrieval algorithm developed for the GOMOS instrument onboard Envisat as an alternative to the operational retrieval (IPF). AerGOM enhances the quality of the stratospheric aerosol extinction retrieval due to the extension of the spectral range used, refines the aerosol spectral parameterization, the simultaneous inversion of all atmospheric species as well as an improvement of the Rayleigh scattering correction. The retrieval algorithm allows for a good characterization of the stratospheric aerosol extinction for a wide range of wavelengths.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present the results of stratospheric aerosol extinction comparisons between AerGOM and various spaceborne instruments (SAGE II, SAGE III, POAM III, ACE-MAESTRO and OSIRIS) for different wavelengths. The aerosol extinction intercomparisons for λ < 700 nm and above 20 km show agreements with SAGE II version 7 and SAGE III version 4.0 within ±15 % and ±45 %, respectively. There is a strong positive bias below 20 km at λ < 700 nm, which suggests that cirrus clouds at these altitudes have a large impact on the extinction values. Comparisons performed with GOMOS IPF v6.01 alongside AerGOM show that at short wavelengths and altitudes below 20 km, IPF retrievals are more accurate when evaluated against SAGE II and SAGE III but are much less precise than AerGOM. A modified aerosol spectral parameterization can improve AerGOM in this spectral and altitude range and leads to results that have an accuracy similar to IPF retrievals. Comparisons of AerGOM aerosol extinction coefficients with OSIRIS and SAGE III measurements at wavelengths larger than 700 nm show a very large negative bias at altitudes above 25 km. Therefore, the use of AerGOM aerosol extinction data is not recommended for λ > 700 nm.\r\n\r\nDue to the unique observational technique of GOMOS, some of the results appear to be dependent on the star occultation parameters such as star apparent temperature and magnitude, solar zenith angle and latitude of observation. A systematic analysis is carried out to identify biases in the dataset, using the various spaceborne instruments as references. The quality of the aerosol retrieval is mainly influenced by the star magnitude, as well as star temperature to a lesser degree. To ensure good-quality profiles, we suggest to select occultations performed with star magnitude M < 2.5 and star temperature T > 6 × 103 K. Stray-light contamination is negligible for extinction coefficients below 700 nm using occultations performed with a solar zenith angle  > 110° but becomes important at larger wavelengths. Comparison of AerGOM results in the tropics shows an enhanced bias below 20 km that seem to confirm cirrus clouds as its cause. There are also differences between mid-latitude and tropical observations that cannot yet be explained, with a bias difference of up to 25 %.\r\n\r\nThis bias characterization is extremely important for data users and might prove valuable for the production of unbiased long-term merged dataset.		1

This extends the ACE-FTS climatology to include profile information in the mesosphere and carbon-containing species in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Climatologies of 21 species, based on nine years of observations, are calculated, providing the most comprehensive and self-consistent climatology available from limb-viewing satellite measurements. Pressure levels from the upper troposphere to the mesosphere and lower thermosphere are included with ~3 to 4 km vertical resolution up to 10−4 hPa (~105 km). Volume mixing ratio values are filtered prior to the climatology estimation using the ACE-FTS data quality recommendations. The multi-year mean climatology contains zonal mean profiles for monthly and three-monthly (DJF, MAM, JJA, and SON) periods. These are provided with 5-degree spacing in either latitude or equivalent latitude. Also, the local daytime and nighttime distributions are provided separately for nitrogen-containing species, enabling diurnal differences to be investigated. Based on this climatology, examples of typical spatiotemporal patterns for trace gases in the mesosphere and for carbon-containing gases in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are discussed.		1

Interferences by HNO3, CO2 and H2O have to be accounted for. Application of this approach to observations recorded within the framework of long-term monitoring activities carried out at the northern mid-latitude, high-altitude Jungfraujoch station in Switzerland (46.5°N, 8.0°E, 3580 m above sea level) has provided a total column times series spanning the 1989 to mid-2015 time period. A fit to the HCFC-142b daily mean total column time series shows a statistically-significant long-term trend of (1.23±0.08×1013 molec cm−2) per year from 2000 to 2010, at the 2-σ confidence level. This corresponds to a significant atmospheric accumulation of (0.94±0.06) ppt (1 ppt=1/1012) per year for the mean tropospheric mixing ratio, at the 2−σ confidence level. Over the subsequent time period (2010–2014), we note a significant slowing down in the HCFC-142b buildup. Our ground-based FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) results are compared with relevant data sets derived from surface in situ measurements at the Mace Head and Jungfraujoch sites of the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) network and from occultation measurements by the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer) instrument on-board the SCISAT satellite.		1

The random error for SOFIE CH4 is ~0.1–1% up to ~50 km and degrades to ~9% at ∼ 70 km. The systematic error remains at ~4% throughout the stratosphere and lower mesosphere. Comparisons with CH4 data taken by the SCISAT Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and the Envisat Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) show an agreement within ~15% in the altitude range ~30–60 km. Below ~25 km SOFIE CH4 is systematically higher (≥20%), while above ~65 km it is lower by a similar percentage. The sign change from the positive to negative bias occurs between ~55 km and ~60 km (or ~40 km and ~45 km) in the Northern (or Southern) Hemisphere. Methane, H2O, and 2CH4 + H2O yearly differences from their values in 2009 are examined using SOFIE and MIPAS CH4 and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measured H2O. It is concluded that 2CH4 + H2O is conserved with altitude up to an upper limit between ~35 km and ~50 km depending on the season. In summer this altitude is higher. In the Northern Hemisphere the difference relative to 2009 is the largest in late spring and the established difference prevails throughout summer and fall, suggesting that summer and fall are dynamically quiet. In both hemispheres during winter there are disturbances (with a period of ~1 month) that travel downward throughout the stratosphere with a speed similar to the winter descent.		1

Here we focus on data versions 6 and 7 provided by the ESA processor. These data sets have been assimilated by the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE). The CH4 and N2O retrieved profiles can oscillate, especially in the tropical lower stratosphere. Using the averaging kernels of the observations and a background error covariance matrix, which has previously been calibrated, allows the system to partly remedy this issue and provide assimilated fields that are more regular vertically. In general, there is a good agreement between the BASCOE analyses and independent observations from ACE–FTS (CH4 and N2O) and MLS (N2O), demonstrating the general good quality of CH4 and N2O retrievals provided by MIPAS ESA. Nevertheless, this study also identifies two issues in these data sets. First, time series of the observations show unexpected discontinuities due to an abrupt change in the gain of MIPAS band B, generally occurring after the instrument decontamination. Since the calibration is performed weekly, the abrupt change in the gain affects the measurements until the subsequent calibration is performed. Second, the correlations between BASCOE analyses and independent observations are poor in the lower stratosphere, especially in the tropics, probably due to the presence of outliers in the assimilated data. In this region, we recommend using MIPAS CH4 and N2O retrievals with caution.		1

Version 2.2 of ACE-FTS NO, NO2, HNO3, N2O5, and ClONO2 has previously been validated, and this study compares the most recent version (v3.5) of these five ACE-FTS products to spatially and temporally coincident measurements from other satellite instruments – GOMOS, HALOE, MAESTRO, MIPAS, MLS, OSIRIS, POAM III, SAGE III, SCIAMACHY, SMILES, and SMR. For each ACE-FTS measurement, a photochemical box model was used to simulate the diurnal variations of the NOy species and the ACE-FTS measurements were scaled to the local times of the coincident measurements. The comparisons for all five species show good agreement with correlative satellite measurements. For NO in the altitude range of 25–50 km, ACE-FTS typically agrees with correlative data to within −10 %. Instrument-averaged mean relative differences are approximately −10 % at 30–40 km for NO2, within ±7 % at 8–30 km for HNO3, better than −7 % at 21–34 km for local morning N2O5, and better than −8 % at 21–34 km for ClONO2. Where possible, the variations in the mean differences due to changes in the comparison local time and latitude are also discussed.		1

The derived fluorescence efficiencies permit estimation and interpretation of ro-vibrational infrared line intensities of CN in exospheres exposed to solar (or stellar) radiation. Our g-factors are applicable to astronomical observations of CN extending from infrared to optical wavelengths, and we compare them with previous calculations in the literature. The new model enables extraction of rotational temperature, column abundance, and production rate from astronomical observations of CN in the inner coma of comets. Our model accounts for excitation and de-excitation of rotational levels in the ground vibrational state by collisions, solar excitation to the ${A}^{2}{{\\rm{\\Pi }}}_{{\\rm{i}}}$ and ${B}^{2}{{\\rm{\\Sigma }}}^{+}$ electronically excited states followed by cascade to ro-vibrational levels of ${X}^{2}{{\\rm{\\Sigma }}}^{+}$, and direct solar infrared pumping of ro-vibrational levels in the ${X}^{2}{{\\rm{\\Sigma }}}^{+}$ state. The model uses advanced solar spectra acquired at high spectral resolution at the relevant infrared and optical wavelengths and considers the heliocentric radial velocity of the comet (the Swings effect) when assessing the exciting solar flux for a given transition. We present model predictions for the variation of fluorescence rates with rotational temperature and heliocentric radial velocity. Furthermore, we test our fluorescence model by comparing predicted and measured line-by-line intensities for ${X}^{2}{{\\rm{\\Sigma }}}^{+}$ (1–0) in comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), thereby identifying multiple emission lines observed at IR wavelengths.		1

Further progress in some domains depends on a more detailed understanding of these data sets, especially of their long-term stability and their mutual consistency. To this end, we made a systematic assessment of 14 limb and occultation sounders that, together, provide more than three decades of global ozone profile measurements. In particular, we considered the latest operational Level-2 records by SAGE II, SAGE III, HALOE, UARS MLS, Aura MLS, POAM II, POAM III, OSIRIS, SMR, GOMOS, MIPAS, SCIAMACHY, ACE-FTS and MAESTRO. Central to our work is a consistent and robust analysis of the comparisons against the ground-based ozonesonde and stratospheric ozone lidar networks. It allowed us to investigate, from the troposphere up to the stratopause, the following main aspects of satellite data quality: long-term stability, overall bias and short-term variability, together with their dependence on geophysical parameters and profile representation. In addition, it permitted us to quantify the overall consistency between the ozone profilers. Generally, we found that between 20 and 40 km the satellite ozone measurement biases are smaller than ±5 %, the short-term variabilities are less than 5–12 % and the drifts are at most ±5 % decade−1 (or even ±3 % decade−1 for a few records). The agreement with ground-based data degrades somewhat towards the stratopause and especially towards the tropopause where natural variability and low ozone abundances impede a more precise analysis. In part of the stratosphere a few records deviate from the preceding general conclusions; we identified biases of 10 % and more (POAM II and SCIAMACHY), markedly higher single-profile variability (SMR and SCIAMACHY) and significant long-term drifts (SCIAMACHY, OSIRIS, HALOE and possibly GOMOS and SMR as well). Furthermore, we reflected on the repercussions of our findings for the construction, analysis and interpretation of merged data records. Most notably, the discrepancies between several recent ozone profile trend assessments can be mostly explained by instrumental drift. This clearly demonstrates the need for systematic comprehensive multi-instrument comparison analyses.		1

Chosen for the purpose of observing high-latitude processes, the ACE orbit provides sampling of both regions in 8 of 12 months of the year, with coverage in all seasons. The ACE water vapour sensors, namely MAESTRO (Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation) and the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) are currently the only satellite instruments that can probe from the lower stratosphere down to the mid-troposphere to study the vertical profile of the response of UTLS water vapour to the annular modes. \r\n\r\nThe Arctic oscillation (AO), also known as the northern annular mode (NAM), explains 64 % (r = −0.80) of the monthly variability in water vapour at northern high latitudes observed by ACE-MAESTRO between 5 and 7 km using only winter months (January to March, 2004–2013). Using a seasonal time step and all seasons, 45 % of the variability is explained by the AO at 6.5 ± 0.5 km, similar to the 46 % value obtained for southern high latitudes at 7.5 ± 0.5 km explained by the Antarctic oscillation or southern annular mode (SAM). A large negative AO event in March 2013 produced the largest relative water vapour anomaly at 5.5 km (+70 %) over the ACE record. A similarly large event in the 2010 boreal winter, which was the largest negative AO event in the record (1950–2015), led to > 50 % increases in water vapour observed by MAESTRO and ACE-FTS at 7.5 km.		1

The vertical resolution varies from 3.5–4 km in the lower stratosphere up to 6–10 km at the upper end of the profiles, with estimated total errors of 5–20 pptv for single profiles of SO2. Comparisons with the few available observations of SO2 up to high altitudes from ATMOS for a volcanically perturbed situation from ACE-FTS and, at the lowest altitudes, with stratospheric in situ observations reveal general consistency of the datasets. The observations are the first empirical confirmation of features of the stratospheric SO2 distribution, which have only been shown by models up to now: (1) the local maximum of SO2 at around 25–30 km altitude, which is explained by the conversion of carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the precursor of the Junge layer; and (2) the downwelling of SO2-rich air to altitudes of 25–30 km at high latitudes during winter and its subsequent depletion on availability of sunlight. This has been proposed as the reason for the sudden appearance of enhanced concentrations of condensation nuclei during Arctic and Antarctic spring. Further, the strong increase of SO2 to values of 80–100 \\unit{pptv} in the upper stratosphere through photolysis of H2SO4 has been confirmed. Lower stratospheric variability of SO2 could mainly be explained by volcanic activity, and no hints of a strong anthropogenic influence have been found. Regression analysis revealed a QBO (quasi-biennial oscillation) signal of the SO2 time series in the tropics at about 30–35 km, an SAO (semi-annual oscillation) signal at tropical and subtropical latitudes above 32 km and annual periodics predominantly at high latitudes. Further, the analysis indicates a correlation with the solar cycle in the tropics and southern subtropics above 30 km. Significant negative linear trends are found in the tropical lower stratosphere, probably due to reduced tropical volcanic activity and at southern mid-latitudes above 35 km. A positive trend is visible in the lower and middle stratosphere at polar to subtropical southern latitudes.		1

The amount of ozone-depleting compounds in the stratosphere (as measured by equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine – EESC) was maximised in the second half of the 1990s. We examine the periods before and after the peak to see if any change in trend is discernible in the ozone record that might be attributable to a change in the EESC trend, though no attribution is attempted. Prior to 1998, trends in the upper stratosphere (~ 45 km, 4 hPa) are found to be −5 to −10 % per decade at mid-latitudes and closer to −5 % per decade in the tropics. No trends are found in the mid-stratosphere (28 km, 30 hPa). Negative trends are seen in the lower stratosphere at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres and in the deep tropics. However, it is hard to be categorical about the trends in the lower stratosphere for three reasons: (i) there are fewer measurements, (ii) the data quality is poorer, and (iii) the measurements in the 1990s are perturbed by aerosols from the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991. These findings are similar to those reported previously even though the measurements for the main satellite and ground-based records have been revised. \r\n\r\nThere is no sign of a continued negative trend in the upper stratosphere since 1998: instead there is a hint of an average positive trend of ~ 2 % per decade in mid-latitudes and ~ 3 % per decade in the tropics. The significance of these upward trends is investigated using different assumptions of the independence of the trend estimates found from different data sets. The averaged upward trends are significant if the trends derived from various data sets are assumed to be independent (as in Pawson et al., 2014) but are generally not significant if the trends are not independent. This occurs because many of the underlying measurement records are used in more than one merged data set. At this point it is not possible to say which assumption is best. Including an estimate of the drift of the overall ozone observing system decreases the significance of the trends. The significance will become clearer as (i) more years are added to the observational record, (ii) further improvements are made to the historic ozone record (e.g. through algorithm development), and (iii) the data merging techniques are refined, particularly through a more rigorous treatment of uncertainties.		1

They are compared with in situ and lidar observations obtained during a series of aircraft measurement campaigns as part of the International Polar Year POLARCAT activities in spring and summer 2008. Different air masses were sampled during the campaigns including clean air, polluted plumes originating from anthropogenic sources, forest fire plumes from the three northern continents, and stratospheric-influenced air masses. The comparison between IASI O3 [0–8 km], [0–12 km] partial columns and profiles with collocated aircraft observations is achieved by taking into account the different sensitivity and geometry of the sounding instruments. A detailed analysis is provided and the agreement is discussed in terms of vertical sensitivity and surface properties at the location of the observations. Overall, IASI O3 profiles are found to be in relatively good agreement with smoothed in situ and lidar profiles in the free troposphere with differences of less than 40% (25% over sea for both seasons) and 10%, respectively. The correlation between IASI O3 retrieved partial columns and the smoothed aircraft partial columns is good with DC-8 in situ data in spring over North America (r = 0.68), and over Greenland with ATR-42 lidar measurements in summer (r = 0.67). Correlations with other data are less significant highlighting the difficulty of IASI to capture precisely the O3 variability in the Arctic upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). This is particularly noted in comparison with the [0–12 km] partial columns. The IASI [0–8 km] partial columns display a low negative bias (by less than 26% over snow) compared to columns derived from in situ measurements. Despite the relatively high biases of the IASI retrievals in the Arctic UTLS, our analysis shows that IASI can be used to identify, using O3 / CO ratios, stratospheric intrusions.		1

For the MIPAS full-resolution period (2002–2004) these are V5H_CH4_21 and V5H_N2O_21 and for the reduced-resolution period (2005–2012) these are V5R_CH4_224, V5R_CH4_225, V5R_N2O_224 and V5R_N2O_225. Here, we compare CH4 profiles to those measured by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer on board of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE-FTS), the HALogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), to the Global Cooperative Air Sampling Network (GCASN) surface data. We find the MIPAS CH4 profiles below 25 km to be typically higher of the order of 0.1 ppmv for both measurement periods. N2O profiles are compared to those measured by ACE-FTS, the Microwave Limb Sounder on board of the Aura satellite (Aura-MLS) and the Sub-millimetre Radiometer on board of the Odin satellite (Odin-SMR) as well as to the Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species Group (HATS) surface data. The mixing ratios of the satellite instruments agree well with each other for the full-resolution period. For the reduced-resolution period, MIPAS produces similar values as Odin-SMR, but higher values than ACE-FTS and HATS. Below 27 km, the MIPAS profiles show higher mixing ratios than Aura-MLS, and lower values between 27 and 41 km. Cross-comparisons between the two MIPAS measurement periods show that they generally agree quite well, but, especially for CH4, the reduced-resolution period seems to produce slightly higher mixing ratios than the full-resolution data.		1

The budgets were calculated using ACE-FTS version 3.0 retrievals of the volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of 9 chlorine-containing species: CCl4, CFC-12 (CCl2F2), CFC-11 (CCl3F), COCl2, COClF, HCFC-22 (CHF2Cl), CH3Cl, HCl and ClONO2. These data were supplemented with calculated VMRs from the SLIMCAT 3-D chemical transport model (CFC-113, CFC-114, CFC-115, H-1211, H-1301, HCFC-141b, HCFC-142b, ClO and HOCl). The total chlorine profiles are dominated by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons up to 24 km in the tropics and 19 km in the extra-tropics. In this altitude range CFCs and halons account for 58% of the total chlorine VMR. Above this altitude HCl increasingly dominates the total chlorine profile, reaching a maximum of 95% of total chlorine at 54 km. All total chlorine profiles exhibit a positive slope with altitude, suggesting that the total chlorine VMR is now decreasing with time. This conclusion is supported by the time series of the mean stratospheric total chlorine budgets which show mean decreases in total stratospheric chlorine of 0.38 ± 0.03% per year in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics, 0.35 ± 0.07% per year in the Northern Hemisphere tropical stratosphere, 0.54 ± 0.16% per year in the Southern Hemisphere tropics and 0.53 ± 0.12% per year in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical stratosphere for 2004–2009. Globally stratospheric chlorine is decreasing by 0.46 ± 0.02% per year. Both global warming potential-weighted chlorine and ozone depletion potential-weighted chlorine are decreasing at all latitudes. These results show that the Montreal Protocol has had a significant effect in reducing emissions of both ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases.		1

Two cases are considered in the northern polar regions: (1) descent of mesospheric NOx in February–March 2009 after a major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) and, for comparison, (2) early 2007 when no NOx descent occurred. The model uses the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational data for winds and temperature, and we force NOx at the model upper altitude boundary (80 km) with ACE-FTS observations. We then compare the model results with ACE-FTS observations at lower altitudes. For the periods studied, geomagnetic indices are low, which indicates absence of local NOx production by particle precipitation. This gives us a good opportunity to study effects of atmospheric transport on polar NOx. The model results show no NOx descent in 2007, in agreement with ACE-FTS. In contrast, a large amount of NOx descends in February–March 2009 from the upper to lower mesosphere at latitudes larger than 60° N, i.e. inside the polar vortex. Both observations and model results suggest NOx increases of 150–200 ppb (i.e. by factor of 50) at 65 km due to the descent. However, the model underestimates the amount of NOx around 55 km by 40–60 ppb. According to the model results, chemical loss of NOx is insignificant during the descent period, i.e. polar NOx is mainly controlled by dynamics. The descent is terminated and the polar NOx amounts return to pre-descent levels in mid-March, when the polar vortex breaks. The break-up prevents the descending NOx from reaching the upper stratosphere, where it could participate in catalytic ozone destruction. Both ACE-FTS observations and FinROSE show a decrease of ozone of 20–30 % at 30–50 km from mid-February to mid-March. In the model, these ozone changes are not related to the descent but are due to solar activation of halogen and NOx chemistry.		1

The short-lived species NO2 is one of the key target products of MIPAS that are operationally retrieved from limb emission spectra measured in the stratosphere and mesosphere. Within the MIPAS validation activities, a large number of independent observations from balloons, satellites and ground-based stations have been compared to European Space Agency (ESA) version 4.61 operational NO2 data comprising the time period from July 2002 until March 2004 where MIPAS measured with full spectral resolution. Comparisons between MIPAS and balloon-borne observations carried out in 2002 and 2003 in the Arctic, at mid-latitudes, and in the tropics show a very good agreement below 40 km altitude with a mean deviation of roughly 3%, virtually without any significant bias. The comparison to ACE satellite observations exhibits only a small negative bias of MIPAS which appears not to be significant. The independent satellite instruments HALOE, SAGE II, and POAM III confirm in common for the spring-summer time period a negative bias of MIPAS in the Arctic and a positive bias in the Antarctic middle and upper stratosphere exceeding frequently the combined systematic error limits. In contrast to the ESA operational processor, the IMK/IAA retrieval code allows accurate inference of NO2 volume mixing ratios under consideration of all important non-LTE processes. Large differences between both retrieval results appear especially at higher altitudes, above about 50 to 55 km. These differences might be explained at least partly by non-LTE under polar winter conditions but not at mid-latitudes. Below this altitude region mean differences between both processors remain within 5% (during night) and up to 10% (during day) under undisturbed (September 2002) conditions and up to 40% under perturbed polar night conditions (February and March 2004). The intercomparison of ground-based NDACC observations shows no significant bias between the FTIR measurements in Kiruna (68° N) and MIPAS in summer 2003 but larger deviations in autumn and winter. The mean deviation over the whole comparison period remains within 10%. A mean negative bias of 15% for MIPAS daytime and 8% for nighttime observations has been determined for UV-vis comparisons over Harestua (60° N). Results of a pole-to-pole comparison of ground-based DOAS/UV-visible sunrise and MIPAS mid-morning column data has shown that the mean agreement in 2003 falls within the accuracy limit of the comparison method. Altogether, it can be indicated that MIPAS NO2 profiles yield valuable information on the vertical distribution of NO2 in the lower and middle stratosphere (below about 45 km) during day and night with an overall accuracy of about 10–20% and a precision of typically 5–15% such that the data are useful for scientific studies. In cases where extremely high NO2 occurs in the mesosphere (polar winter) retrieval results in the lower and middle stratosphere are less accurate than under undisturbed atmospheric conditions.		1

The observations use the solar occultation technique and document the fall-off in the mixing ratio of CO2 in the MLT region. The beginning of the fall-off of the CO2, or "knee" occurs at about 78 km and lies higher than in the CRISTA-1 measurements (~70 km) but lower than in the SABER 1.06 (~80 km) and much lower than in rocket measurements. We also present the measurements of CO obtained concurrently which provide important constraints for analysis. We have compared the ACE measurements with simulations of the CO2 and CO distributions in the vertically extended version of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM). Applying standard chemistry we find that we cannot get agreement between the model and ACE CO2 observations although the CO observations are adequately reproduced. There appears to be about a 10 km offset compared to the observed ACE CO2, with the model "knee" occurring too high. In analyzing the disagreement, we have investigated the variation of several parameters of interest (photolysis rates, formation rate for CO2, and the impact of uncertainty in turbulent eddy diffusion) in order to explore parameter space for this problem. Our conclusions are that there must be a loss process for CO2, about 2–4~times faster than photolysis that will sequester the carbon in some form other than CO and we have speculated on the role of meteoritic dust as a possible candidate. In addition, from this study we have highlighted a possible important role for unresolved vertical eddy diffusion in 3-D models in determining the distribution of candidate species in the mesosphere which requires further study.		1

The SCIAMACHY solar occultation measurements cover the latitudinal range between about 50° N and 70° N. Currently, reasonable results are obtained between 20 and 40 km altitude. Comparisons with correlative ACE-FTS measurements show an average agreement within the expected accuracy of the ACE-FTS data of about 10%. To demonstrate the capability of SCIAMACHY solar occultation measurements in the context of greenhouse gas monitoring, time series of stratospheric CH4 profiles covering the period from 2003 to 2010 have been generated. The SCIAMACHY CH4 profile solar occultation temporal series shows a strong seasonal cycle. This is attributed to the variations in both time and space of the retrieved data set. At lower altitudes, the observed temporal variations are explained by variations of the tropopause height. The temporal data set is also impacted by variations of the size and duration of the polar vortex in the northern hemisphere. The data set provides unique information about CH4 changes in the stratosphere at mid to high latitudes.		1

Pressure-latitude cross-sections and seasonal time series demonstrate that CMAM reproduces the observed global CO, N2O, and CH4 distributions quite well. Generally, excellent agreement with measurements is found between CO simulations and observations in the stratosphere and mesosphere. Differences between the simulations and the ACE-FTS observations are generally within 30%, and the differences between CMAM results and SMR and MLS observations are slightly larger. These differences are comparable with the difference between the instruments in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. Comparisons of N2O show that CMAM results are usually within 15% of the measurements in the lower and middle stratosphere, and the observations are close to each other. However, the standard version of CMAM has a low N2O bias in the upper stratosphere. The CMAM CH4 distribution also reproduces the observations in the lower stratosphere, but has a similar but smaller negative bias in the upper stratosphere. The negative bias may be due to that the gravity drag is not fully resolved in the model. The simulated polar CO evolution in the Arctic and Antarctic agrees with the ACE and MLS observations. CO measurements from 2006 show evidence of enhanced descent of air from the mesosphere into the stratosphere in the Arctic after strong stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs). CMAM also shows strong descent of air after SSWs. In the tropics, CMAM captures the annual oscillation in the lower stratosphere and the semiannual oscillations at the stratopause and mesopause seen in Aura/MLS CO and N2O observations and in Odin/SMR N2O observations. The Odin/SMR and Aura/MLS N2O observations also show a quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the upper stratosphere, whereas, the CMAM does not have QBO included. This study confirms that CMAM is able to simulate middle atmospheric transport processes reasonably well.		1

Limb viewing space-borne sounders, observing the atmosphere along tangential optical paths, offer a vertical resolution of a few kilometers for profiles, which is much better than currently flying or planned nadir sounding instruments can achieve. In this paper, we analyse the feasibility of obtaining CO2 vertical profiles in the 5–25 km altitude range from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS, launched in August 2003), high spectral resolution solar occultation measurements. Two main difficulties must be overcome: (i) the accurate determination of the instrument pointing parameters (tangent heights) and pressure/temperature profiles independently from an a priori CO2 profile, and (ii) the potential impact of uncertainties in the temperature knowledge on the retrieved CO2 profile. The first difficulty has been solved using the \\N collision-induced continuum absorption near 4 μm to determine tangent heights, pressure and temperature from the ACE-FTS spectra. The second difficulty has been solved by a careful selection of CO2 spectral micro-windows. Retrievals using synthetic spectra made under realistic simulation conditions show a vertical resolution close to 2.5 km and accuracy of the order of 2 ppm after averaging over 25 profiles. These results open the way to promising studies of transport mechanisms and carbon fluxes from the ACE-FTS measurements.

With few exceptions we found very good agreement between these instruments and MIPAS with no evidence for any bias in most cases and altitude regions. For balloon-borne measurements typical absolute mean differences are below 0.05 ppbv over the whole altitude range from 10 to 39 km. In case of ACE-FTS observations mean differences are below 0.03 ppbv for observations below 26 km. Above this altitude the comparison with ACE-FTS is affected by the photochemically induced diurnal variation of ClONO2. Correction for this by use of a chemical transport model led to an overcompensation of the photochemical effect by up to 0.1 ppbv at altitudes of 30–35 km in case of MIPAS-ACE-FTS comparisons while for the balloon-borne observations no such inconsistency has been detected. The comparison of MIPAS derived total column amounts with ground-based observations revealed no significant bias in the MIPAS data. Mean differences between MIPAS and FTIR column abundances are 0.11±0.12×1014 cm−2 (1.0±1.1%) and −0.09±0.19×1014 cm−2 (−0.8±1.7%), depending on the coincidence criterion applied. χ2 tests have been performed to assess the combined precision estimates of MIPAS and the related instruments. When no exact coincidences were available as in case of MIPAS – FTIR or MIPAS – ACE-FTS comparisons it has been necessary to take into consideration a coincidence error term to account for χ2 deviations. From the resulting χ2 profiles there is no evidence for a systematic over/underestimation of the MIPAS random error analysis.		1

After the October–November 2003 SPEs and in early 2004, significant enhancements of NOx(=NO+NO2) in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere in the Northern Hemisphere were observed by several satellite instruments. Here we present global full chemistry calculations performed with the CLaMS model to study the impact of mesospheric NOx intrusions on Arctic polar ozone loss processes in the stratosphere. Several model simulations are preformed with different upper boundary conditions for NOx at 2000 K potential temperature (≈50 km altitude). In our study we focus on the impact of the non-local production of NOx, which means the downward transport of enhanced NOx from the mesosphere to the stratosphere. The local production of NOx in the stratosphere is neglected. Our findings show that intrusions of mesospheric air into the stratosphere, transporting high burdens of NOx, affect the composition of the Arctic polar region down to about 400 K (≈17–18 km). We compare our simulated NOx and O3 mixing ratios with satellite observations by ACE-FTS and MIPAS processed at IMK/IAA and derive an upper limit for the ozone loss caused by enhanced mesospheric NOx. Our findings show that in the Arctic polar vortex (equivalent lat.>70° N) the accumulated column ozone loss between 350–2000 K potential temperature (≈14–50 km altitude) caused by the SPEs in October–November 2003 in the stratosphere is up to 3.3 DU with an upper limit of 5.5 DU until end of November. Further, we found that about 10 DU, but in any case lower than 18 DU, accumulated ozone loss additionally occurred until end of March 2004 caused by the transport of mesospheric NOx-rich air in early 2004. The solar-proton-produced NOx above 55 km due to the SPEs of October–November 2003 had a negligibly small impact on ozone loss processes through the end of November in the lower stratosphere (350–700 K≈14–27 km). The mesospheric NOx intrusions in early 2004 yielded a lower stratospheric ozone loss of about 3.5 DU, and clearly lower than 6.5 DU through the end of March. Overall, the non-local production of NOx is an additional variability in the existing variations of the ozone loss observed in the Arctic.		1

Three or four zenith-sky viewing UV-visible spectrometers have taken part in each of the three campaigns. The differential slant column densities and vertical column densities of ozone and NO2 from these instruments have been compared following the methods of the UV-visible Working Group of the NDACC (Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change). The instruments are found to partially agree within the required accuracies for both species, although both the vertical and slant column densities are more scattered than required. This might be expected given the spatial and temporal variability of the Arctic stratosphere in spring. The vertical column densities are also compared to integrated total columns from ozonesondes and integrated partial columns from the ACE-FTS (ACE-Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and ACE-MAESTRO (ACE-Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation) instruments on board ACE. For both species, the columns from the ground-based instruments and the ozonesondes are found to generally agree within their combined error bars. The ACE-FTS ozone partial columns and the ground-based total columns agree within 4.5%, averaged over the three campaigns. The ACE-MAESTRO ozone partial columns are generally smaller than those of the ground-based instruments, by an average of 9.9%, and are smaller than the ACE-FTS columns by an average of 14.4%. The ACE-FTS NO2 partial columns are an average of 13.4% smaller than the total columns from the ground-based instruments, as expected. The ACE-MAESTRO NO2 partial columns are larger than the total columns of the ground-based instruments by an average of 2.5% and are larger than the partial columns of the ACE-FTS by an average of 15.5%.		1

In support of the main balloon launch, a suite of five zenith-sky and direct-Sun-viewing UV-visible ground-based spectrometers was deployed, primarily measuring ozone and NO2 total columns. Three Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs) that were part of the balloon payload also performed ground-based measurements of several species, including ozone. Ground-based measurements of ozone and NO2 differential slant column densities from the zenith-viewing UV-visible instruments are presented herein. They are found to partially agree within NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) standards for instruments certified for process studies and satellite validation. Vertical column densities of ozone from the zenith-sky UV-visible instruments, the FTSs, a Brewer spectrophotometer, and ozonesondes are compared, and found to agree within the combined error estimates of the instruments (15%). NO2 vertical column densities from two of the UV-visible instruments are compared, and are also found to agree within combined error (15%).		1

This is the first application of satellite-based limb scattering to study upper tropospheric NO2. We have searched two years (May 2003–May 2005) of OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imager System) operational NO2 concentrations (version 2.3/2.4) to find large enhancements in the observations by comparing with photochemical box model calculations and by identifying local maxima in NO2 volume mixing ratio. We find that lightning is the main production mechanism responsible for the large enhancements in OSIRIS NO2 observations as expected. Similar patterns in the abundances and spatial distribution of the NO2 enhancements are obtained by perturbing the lightning within the GEOS-Chem 3-dimensional chemical transport model. In most cases, the presence of lightning is confirmed with coincident imagery from LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) and the spatial extent of the NO2 enhancement is mapped using nadir observations of tropospheric NO2 at high spatial resolution from SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography) and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument). The combination of the lightning and chemical sensors allows us to investigate globally the role of lightning to the abundance of NO2 in the upper troposphere (UT). Lightning contributes 60% of the tropical upper tropospheric NO2 in GEOS-Chem simulations. The spatial and temporal distribution of NO2 enhancements from lightning (May 2003–May 2005) is investigated. The enhancements generally occur at 12 to 13 km more frequently than at 10 to 11 km. This is consistent with the notion that most of the NO2 is forming and persisting near the cloud top altitude in the tropical upper troposphere. The latitudinal distribution is mostly as expected. In general, the thunderstorms exhibiting weaker vertical development (e.g. 11≤z≤13 km) extend latitudinally as far poleward as 45° but the thunderstorms with stronger vertical development (z≥14 km) tend to be located within 33° of the equator. There is also the expected hemispheric asymmetry in the frequency of the NO2 enhancements, as most were observed in the northern hemisphere for the period analyzed.		1

The highest-resolution instrument has a maximum optical path difference of 250 cm, and the two lower-resolution instruments have maximum optical path differences of 50 cm and 25 cm. The results indicate that the two lower-resolution instruments can retrieve total column amounts of O3, HCl, N2O and CH4 using the SFIT2 retrieval code with percent differences from the high-resolution instrument generally better than 4%. Total column amounts of the stratospheric species (O3 and HCl) have larger differences than those of the tropospheric species (N2O and CH4). Instrument line shape (ILS) information is found to be of critical importance when retrieving total columns of stratospheric gases from the lower-resolution instruments. Including the ILS information in the retrievals significantly reduces the difference in total column amounts between the three instruments. The remaining errors for stratospheric species total column amounts can be attributed to the lower sensitivity of the lower-resolution FTSs to the stratosphere.		1

Here we focus on the partitioning between the inorganic chlorine reservoirs HCl and ClONO2 and their activation into ClO. The simultaneous measurement of these species by the ACE-FTS provides the data needed to follow chlorine activation during the Arctic winter and the recovery of the Cl-reservoir species ClONO2 and HCl. The time evolution of HCl, ClONO2 and ClO as well as the partitioning between the two reservoir molecules agrees well with previous observations and with our current understanding of chlorine activation during Arctic winter. The results of a chemical box model are also compared with the ACE-FTS measurements and are generally consistent with the measurements.		1

The main upgrades with respect to the previous version of MIPAS temperatures (vM11) are the update of the spectroscopic database, the use of a different climatology of atomic oxygen and carbon dioxide, and the improvement in important technical aspects of the retrieval setup (temperature gradient along the line of sight and offset regularizations, apodization accuracy). Additionally, an updated version of ESA-calibrated L1b spectra (5.02/5.06) is used. The vM21 temperatures correct the main systematic errors of the previous version because they provide on average a 1–2 K warmer stratopause and middle mesosphere, and a 6–10 K colder mesopause (except in high-latitude summers) and lower thermosphere. These lead to a remarkable improvement in MIPAS comparisons with ACE-FTS, MLS, OSIRIS, SABER, SOFIE and the two Rayleigh lidars at Mauna Loa and Table Mountain, which, with a few specific exceptions, typically exhibit differences smaller than 1 K below 50 km and than 2 K at 50–80 km in spring, autumn and winter at all latitudes, and summer at low to midlatitudes. Differences in the high-latitude summers are typically smaller than 1 K below 50 km, smaller than 2 K at 50–65 km and 5 K at 65–80 km. Differences between MIPAS and the other instruments in the mid-mesosphere are generally negative. MIPAS mesopause is within 4 K of the other instruments measurements, except in the high-latitude summers, when it is within 5–10 K, being warmer there than SABER, MLS and OSIRIS and colder than ACE-FTS and SOFIE. The agreement in the lower thermosphere is typically better than 5 K, except for high latitudes during spring and summer, when MIPAS usually exhibits larger vertical gradients.		1

We characterize potential sampling biases in stratospheric trace gas climatologies of the Stratospheric Processes and Their Role in Climate (SPARC) Data Initiative using chemical fields from a chemistry climate model simulation and sampling patterns from 16 satellite-borne instruments. The exercise is performed for the long-lived stratospheric trace gases O3 and H2O. Monthly sampling biases for O3 exceed 10% for many instruments in the high-latitude stratosphere and in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere, while annual mean sampling biases reach values of up to 20% in the same regions for some instruments. Sampling biases for H2O are generally smaller than for O3, although still notable in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere and Southern Hemisphere high latitudes. The most important mechanism leading to monthly sampling bias is nonuniform temporal sampling, i.e., the fact that for many instruments, monthly means are produced from measurements which span less than the full month in question. Similarly, annual mean sampling biases are well explained by nonuniformity in the month-to-month sampling by different instruments. Nonuniform sampling in latitude and longitude are shown to also lead to nonnegligible sampling biases, which are most relevant for climatologies which are otherwise free of biases due to nonuniform temporal sampling.		1

However, to date the complexity of the ion chemistry below the mesopause (i.e., in the D region ionosphere) has restricted global models to simplified EEP/IC parameterizations which are unable to reproduce some important effects, e.g., the increase of mesospheric nitric acid (HNO3). Here we use WACCM-D, a variant of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model which includes a selected set of D region ion chemistry designed to produce the observed effects of EPP/IC. We evaluate the performance of EPP/IC modeling by comparing WACCM-D results for the January 2005 solar proton event (SPE) to those from the standard WACCM and Aura/Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and SCISAT/Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) observations. The results indicate that WACCM-D improves the modeling of HNO3, HCl, ClO, OH, and NOx during the SPE. Northern Hemispheric HNO3 from WACCM-D shows an increase by 2 orders of magnitude at 40–70 km compared to WACCM, reaching 2.6 ppbv, in agreement with the observations. For HCl and ClO, the improvement is most pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere at 40–50 km where WACCM-D predicts a decrease of HCl and increase of ClO by 1.6% and 10%, respectively, similar to MLS data. Compared to WACCM, WACCM-D produces 25–50% less OH and 30–130% more NOx at 70–85 km which leads to better agreement with the observations. Although not addressed here, longer-term NOx impact of ion chemistry could be important for polar stratospheric ozone and middle atmospheric dynamics.		1

The Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on NASA's Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite has been measuring temperatures in the polar atmosphere nearly continuously since 2007. We herein present an improved SOFIE temperature data set and validate it against a variety of satellite and ground-based observations. We find that when taking all comparisons together, SOFIE temperatures are in agreement with independent observations to within reported systematic uncertainties from 15 to 88 km altitude. Between 88 and 95 km SOFIE temperatures have a warm bias that peaks between 10 and 15 K in the Arctic summer and 20–30 K in the Antarctic summer. Much of the warm bias is likely related to uncertainties in prescribed atomic oxygen densities that are required for the SOFIE temperature retrieval.		1

GCMs have long exhibited a moist bias in the tropical and subtropical mid and upper troposphere, which could be due to the mis-representation of cloud processes or of the large-scale circulation, or to excessive diffusion during water vapor transport. The goal of this study is to use observations of the water vapor isotopic ratio to understand the cause of this bias. We compare the three-dimensional distribution of the water vapor isotopic ratio measured from space and ground to that simulated by several versions of the isotopic GCM LMDZ. We show that the combined evaluation of RH and of the water vapor isotopic composition makes it possible to discriminate the most likely cause of RH biases. Models characterized either by an excessive vertical diffusion, an excessive convective detrainment or an underestimated in situ cloud condensation will all produce a moist bias in the free troposphere. However, only an excessive vertical diffusion can lead to a reversed seasonality of the free tropospheric isotopic composition in the subtropics compared to observations. Comparing seven isotopic GCMs suggests that the moist bias found in many GCMs in the mid and upper troposphere most frequently results from an excessive diffusion during vertical water vapor transport. This study demonstrates the added value of water vapor isotopic measurements for interpreting shortcomings in the simulation of RH by climate models.		1

The Ex-UTLS includes the tropopause, a strong static stability gradient and dynamic barrier to transport. The barrier is reflected in tracer profiles. This region exhibits complex dynamical, radiative, and chemical characteristics that place stringent spatial and temporal requirements on observing and modeling systems. The Ex-UTLS couples the stratosphere to the troposphere through chemical constituent transport (of, e.g., ozone), by dynamically linking the stratospheric circulation with tropospheric wave patterns, and via radiative processes tied to optically thick clouds and clear-sky gradients of radiatively active gases. A comprehensive picture of the Ex-UTLS is presented that brings together different definitions of the tropopause, focusing on observed dynamical and chemical structure and their coupling. This integral view recognizes that thermal gradients and dynamic barriers are necessarily linked, that these barriers inhibit mixing and give rise to specific trace gas distributions, and that there are radiative feedbacks that help maintain this structure. The impacts of 21st century anthropogenic changes to the atmosphere due to ozone recovery and climate change will be felt in the Ex-UTLS, and recent simulations of these effects are summarized and placed in context.		1

However, removing ethane spectral signatures from high-resolution terrestrial transmittance spectra has been imperfect because existing quantum mechanical models have been unable to reproduce the observed spectra with sufficient accuracy. To redress this problem, we constructed a line-by-line model for the ν7 band of ethane (C2H6) and applied it to compute telluric transmittances and cometary fluorescence efficiencies. Our model considers accurate spectral parameters, vibration-rotation interactions, and a functional characterization of the torsional hot band. We integrated the new band model into an advanced radiative transfer code for synthesizing the terrestrial atmosphere (LBLRTM), achieving excellent agreement with transmittance data recorded against Mars using three different instruments located in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The retrieved ethane abundances demonstrate the strong hemispheric asymmetry noted in prior surveys of volatile hydrocarbons. We also retrieved sensitive limits for the abundance of ethane on Mars. The most critical validation of the model was obtained by comparing simulations of C2H6 fluorescent emission with spectra of three hydrocarbon-rich comets: C/2004 Q2 (Machholz), 8P/Tuttle, and C/2007 W1 (Boattini). The new model accurately describes the complex emission morphology of the ν7 band at low rotational temperatures and greatly increases the confidence of the retrieved production rates (and rotational temperatures) with respect to previously available fluorescence models.		1

The contribution to the Moon's aspect from sunlight scattered at the Earth's terminator is generally deemed minor. However, our analysis of a published spectrum of the 16 August 2008 lunar eclipse shows that diffuse sunlight is a major component of the measured spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm. The conclusion is supported by two distinct features, namely the spectrum's tail at short wavelengths and the unequal absorption by an oxygen collisional complex at two nearby bands. Our findings are consistent with the presence of the volcanic cloud reported at high northern latitudes following the 7–8 August 2008 eruption in Alaska of the Kasatochi volcano. The cloud both attenuates the unscattered sunlight and enhances moderately the scattered component, thus modifying the contrast between the two contributions.		1

Shepherd	2010	10	Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres				115	20	D20304		Middle atmosphere, Uncertainty quantification, data validation, stratospheric trace gas measurements	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JD014185		publications/pdfs/Toohey_et_al-2010-Journal_of_Geophysical_Research-_Atmospheres_1984-2012.pdf			10.1029/2010JD014185	f	[1] In order to validate the reported precision of space-based atmospheric composition measurements, validation studies often focus on measurements in the tropical stratosphere, where natural variability is weak. The scatter in tropical measurements can then be used as an upper limit on single-profile measurement precision. Here we introduce a method of quantifying the scatter of tropical measurements which aims to minimize the effects of short-term atmospheric variability while maintaining large enough sample sizes that the results can be taken as representative of the full data set. We apply this technique to measurements of O3, HNO3, CO, H2O, NO, NO2, N2O, CH4, CCl2F2, and CCl3F produced by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). Tropical scatter in the ACE-FTS retrievals is found to be consistent with the reported random errors (RREs) for H2O and CO at altitudes above 20 km, validating the RREs for these measurements. Tropical scatter in measurements of NO, NO2, CCl2F2, and CCl3F is roughly consistent with the RREs as long as the effect of outliers in the data set is reduced through the use of robust statistics. The scatter in measurements of O3, HNO3, CH4, and N2O in the stratosphere, while larger than the RREs, is shown to be consistent with the variability simulated in the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model. This result implies that, for these species, stratospheric measurement scatter is dominated by natural variability, not random error, which provides added confidence in the scientific value of single-profile measurements.		1

A procedure has been developed for retrieving average dry air CO2 mole fractions image in the altitude range 7–10 km from the SCISAT-1 spectra. Using the N2 continuum absorption in a window region near 2500 cm−1, altitude shifts are applied to the tangent heights retrieved in version 2.2 SCISAT-1 processing, while cloudy or aerosol-impacted measurements are eliminated. Monthly mean image covering 60°S to 60°N latitude for February 2004 to March 2008 has been analyzed with consistent trends inferred in both hemispheres. The ACE image time series have been compared with previously reported surface network measurements, predictions based on upper tropospheric aircraft measurements, and space-based measurements. The retrieved image from the ACE-FTS spectra are higher on average by a factor of 1.07 ± 0.025 in the Northern Hemisphere and by a factor of 1.09 ± 0.019 on average in the Southern Hemisphere compared to surface station measurements covering the same time span. The ACE-derived trend is ∼0.2% per year higher than measured at surface stations during the same observation period.		1

Multiyear time series of equatorial upper stratospheric H2O + 2*CH4 show temporal variations during periods of relative long-term stability in water vapor and methane entering the stratosphere. These variations, which are anticorrelated to CH4, are quasibiennial and seasonal in nature, and peak near 2 hPa with a magnitude of 3% of the H2O + 2*CH4 mixing ratio. We find that the ratio of the changes in water vapor to the changes in methane is consistently >2 over the entire equatorial upper stratosphere in HALOE, ACE, and MIPAS data. Ratios of the H2O to CH4 changes calculated from the CHEM2D model are similar, but slightly smaller, and the variations in H2O + 2*CH4 are balanced by nearly equivalent variations in molecular hydrogen. We use this relationship to infer molecular hydrogen mixing ratios from the observations which show that its mixing ratio decreases with altitude above 5 hPa. This net loss in molecular hydrogen drives additional water vapor production so that multiyear average profiles of H2O + 2*CH4 from HALOE, ACE, and MIPAS show an ∼0.4 ppmv increase between 5 hPa and 1.5 hPa, so that total hydrogen is conserved. Collectively, these results illustrate the importance of molecular hydrogen in the equatorial upper stratospheric hydrogen budget.		1

Comparisons are done for O3, HF, HCl, H2O, CH4, NO, NO2, and temperature. Statistics from 32 profile pairs that were reasonably close in space and time are presented. The temperature retrievals agree to within ±2 K, an important result as all other retrievals depend on this. ACE gas retrievals are typically higher than HALOE, with the exception of NO and NO2 where HALOE is higher. This comparison helps provide traceability between two important complementary remote sensing missions, lends confidence to the initial ACE dataset, and provides a baseline for future retrieval improvements.		1

The position of ice O-H stretch band peak varies from 3230cm−1 at T = 120K to 3246cm−1 at T = 155K, which enables the retrieval of ice temperature by fitting a model spectrum to a measured one. The retrieved temperature is independent of cloud vertical and horizontal patchiness and has a random uncertainty of <12K. The retrieval is sensitive to chosen particle shape: cubes, hexagons and spheroids of certain forms give same result. Spheres and rectangular prisms (aspect ratio ≥2) change temperature by 3–4K. For nearly 400 ice spectra analyzed the retrieved temperature for cubes ranges from 120K to 150K with the distribution maximum centered at ∼135K. The standard temperature for same ice spectra retrieved from the gas phase differs considerably and sometimes reaches values of 200K and above.		1

These are obtained by retrieving vertical profiles from 5 to 20 km from infrared solar occultation spectra recorded in 2005 and 2006 by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). Background volume mixing ratios (vmrs) ranging from a few to about 50 pptv (10−12) are measured at the different altitudes, while for certain occultations, vmrs as high as 200 pptv are observed. Zonal distributions and vertically resolved latitudinal distributions are derived for the two year period analyzed, highlighting spatial –including a North-South gradient– as well as seasonal variations. We show the latter to be more pronounced at the highest latitudes, presumably as a result of less active photochemistry during winter. The observation of C2H4 enhancements in remote Arctic regions at high latitudes is consistent with the occurrence of fast transport processes of gaseous pollution from the continents leading to Arctic haze.		1

The ExTL depth is derived using H2O-O3 and CO-O3 correlations. The ExTL top derived from H2O-O3 shows an increase from roughly 1–1.5 km above the thermal tropopause in the subtropics to 3–4 km (2.5–3.5 km) in the north (south) polar region, implying somewhat weaker troposphere-stratosphere-transport in the Southern Hemisphere. The ExTL bottom extends ∼1 km below the thermal tropopause, indicating a persistent stratospheric influence on the troposphere at all latitudes. The ExTL top derived from the CO-O3 correlation is lower, at 2 km or ∼345 K (1.5 km or ∼335 K) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. Its annual mean coincides with the relative temperature maximum just above the thermal tropopause. The vertical CO gradient maximizes at the thermal tropopause, indicating a local minimum in mixing within the tropopause region. The seasonal changes in and the scales of the vertical H2O gradients show a similar pattern as the static stability structure of the tropopause inversion layer (TIL), which provides observational support for the hypothesis that H2O plays a radiative role in forcing and maintaining the structure of the TIL.		1

The measurements utilized in this study span a broad latitudinal range between the deep tropics and northern high latitudes. The data are used to establish the robustness of the HNO3-O3 correlation in the stratosphere and the latitudinal dependence in the correlation. Good agreement is found among the HNO3-O3 correlations observed with the various instruments. Comparing HNO3-O3 correlations relaxes the coincidence criteria necessary when making direct comparisons of HNO3 measurements and allows meaningful comparisons between data sets that are not closely matched in time or space. The utility of this correlation is further demonstrated by establishing vertical profiles of proxy HNO3 mixing ratios using the observed correlation and widely available ozonesonde data. These profiles expand the range of data available for validating remote measurements of HNO3. The HNO3-O3 correlation is also demonstrated as a diagnostic for identifying locally enhanced HNO3 in the upper troposphere. In situ measurements of HNO3 near the tropical tropopause during the Aura validation campaigns are consistent with ACE-FTS observations, with both revealing extremely low mixing ratios (<125 ppt) and a HNO3 minimum in this region.		1

These anomalously high concentrations are associated with the transport of high levels of NOx in the polar night region from the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere in both cases following sudden warming events in the middle of January. The NOx is produced by auroral electron precipitation. Simulations using a middle atmosphere chemistry climate model show significant amounts of N2O are produced in the upper mesosphere from the reaction of NO2 and ground state atomic nitrogen. Thus, N2O acts as a signature of energetic electron precipitation. The model results exhibit polar-night-confined descent of NOx in the wake of sudden warmings and other dynamical regimes when the polar vortex intensifies at high latitudes in the mesosphere.		1

The HIRDLS instrument obtains between 5000 and 7000 HNO3 profiles per day. HIRDLS HNO3 data are generally good over the latitude range of 64°S to 80°N and pressure range 100 to 10 hPa, with some profiles, depending on latitude, having useful information between 100 to 161 hPa. The individual profile “measured” precision is between 10 and 15%, but can be much larger if the HNO3 abundance is low or outside the 100 hPa to 10 hPa range. Global results are compared with the HNO3 observations from version 2.2 of the EOS Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), and it is found that large-scale features are consistent between the two instruments. HIRDLS HNO3 is biased 0–20% low relative to Aura MLS in the mid-to-high latitudes and biased high in the tropical stratosphere. HIRDLS HNO3 is also compared with Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS). In these mostly high-latitude comparisons the HIRDLS HNO3 data are biased 10–30% low, depending on altitude. Finally, the HIRDLS HNO3 is compared to in situ data taken by the NOAA Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS) instrument flown during the 2005 NASA Houston Aura Validation Experiment (AVE) and the ability of HIRDLS to measure HNO3 in the UTLS region is examined.		1

This paper focuses on validation of the MLS stratospheric standard ozone product and its uncertainties, as obtained from the 240 GHz radiometer measurements, with a few results concerning mesospheric ozone. We compare average differences and scatter from matched MLS version 2.2 profiles and coincident ozone profiles from other satellite instruments, as well as from aircraft lidar measurements taken during Aura Validation Experiment (AVE) campaigns. Ozone comparisons are also made between MLS and balloon-borne remote and in situ sensors. We provide a detailed characterization of random and systematic uncertainties for MLS ozone. We typically find better agreement in the comparisons using MLS version 2.2 ozone than the version 1.5 data. The agreement and the MLS uncertainty estimates in the stratosphere are often of the order of 5%, with values closer to 10% (and occasionally 20%) at the lowest stratospheric altitudes, where small positive MLS biases can be found. There is very good agreement in the latitudinal distributions obtained from MLS and from coincident profiles from other satellite instruments, as well as from aircraft lidar data along the MLS track.		1

A total of 5614 measured profiles spanning the period February 2004 through May 2006 were used in the study. The phosgene concentrations display a zonally symmetric pattern with the maximum concentration located approximately over the equator at about 25 km in altitude and the concentration decreases towards the poles. A layer of enhanced concentration of phosgene spans the lower stratosphere over all latitudes, with volume mixing ratios of 20–60 pptv. The ACE observations show lower phosgene concentrations in the stratosphere than were obtained from previous observations in the 1980s and 1990s. This has been attributed to a significant decrease in its source species, particularly two major sources CH3CCl3 and CCl4, since the introduction of restrictions required by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments.		1

The relationship between multiplicative bias and error variance is explored, and three methods are proposed for producing sets of values for three comparison variables: the multiplicative bias, and the error variance for each of two instruments. We illustrate and compare the three methods through the comparison of coincident measurements of the relatively long-lived stratospheric species O3, N2O, and HNO3 from two independent measurement sets: version 2.2 retrievals (with updated O3) from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier transform spectrometer onboard SCISAT-1, and version 1.51 retrievals from the Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder onboard Aura. We find that multiplicative bias between the two measurement sets, compared on a common vertical grid, is significant at some heights for O3 and N2O, and for all heights tested for HNO3. The most realistic estimates of measurement error are produced by a method which incorporates a third correlative data set into the analysis. Using this method, estimated error standard deviations (SDs) are comparable between the two instruments for O3 measurements, and are less than 10% of the mean measurement value between approximately 100 and 1 hPa. ACE N2O measurements are consistent with a 10% error SD at all heights tested, although the uncertainty of the estimates is large at heights above 5 hPa. Estimated MLS N2O error SDs are comparable with those for ACE in the lower stratosphere, but increase steeply with height. For HNO3, estimated error SDs are approximately 10% between 70 and 10 hPa for both instruments. At heights above 10 hPa and below 100 hPa, estimated ACE errors are significantly smaller than those for MLS.		1

Its broad objective is to study the problem of stratospheric ozone depletion, particularly in the Arctic. The main instruments are two spectrometers, one an infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometer and the other a dual optical spectrophotometer sensitive in the UV and visible. Also included are two filtered imagers used to measure altitude profiles of atmospheric extinction and detect thin clouds. The nominal center wavelengths of the filters are 525 nm for the visible (VIS) imager and 1020 nm for the near-infrared (NIR) imager. With the decommissioning of other satellite instruments used to monitor global aerosols [i.e., Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II), SAGE III, Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement (POAM) III, Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE)], the imagers provide much needed continuity in this data record. The data product from the imagers is still, however, in a preliminary state. Funding restrictions in the prelaunch period were responsible for an incomplete characterization of the imagers’ optics and electronics and prevented corrections being made for the problems found during testing. Postlaunch data analysis to correct for image artifacts is ongoing. A comparison with coincidental measurements from SAGE II shows that systematic errors from the preliminary analysis are within 5 and 20% for the VIS and NIR imagers, respectively, for uninverted profiles of optical depth. Despite the preliminary nature of the imager results, a paper describing the imagers and the initial operational data processing code is timely because the data are already being used.		1

The space-based observations are tropospheric NO2 columns from SCIAMACHY, tropospheric O3 columns from OMI and MLS, and upper tropospheric HNO3 from ACE-FTS. A global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) is used to identify locations and time periods in which lightning would be expected to dominate the trace gas observations. The satellite observations are sampled at those locations and time periods. All three observations exhibit a maximum in the tropical Atlantic region and a minimum in the tropical Pacific. This wave-1 pattern is driven by injection of lightning NO into the upper troposphere over the tropical continents, followed by photochemical production of NO2, HNO3, and O3 during transport. Lightning produces a broad enhancement over the tropical Atlantic and Africa of 2–6 × 1014 molecules NO2 cm−2, 4 × 1017 molecules O3 cm−2 (15 Dobson Units), and 125 pptv of upper tropospheric HNO3. The lightning background is 25–50% weaker over the tropical Pacific. A global source of 6 ± 2 Tg N yr−1 from lightning in the model best represents the satellite observations of tropospheric NO2, O3, and HNO3.		1

The focus is the EPP Indirect Effect (IE), whereby NOx produced in the mesosphere or thermosphere via EPP (EPP-NOx) descends to the stratosphere during the polar winter, where it can participate in catalytic ozone destruction. EPP-NOx entering the stratosphere is found to vary in magnitude from 0.1 to 2.6 gigamoles per year, with maximum values occurring in 1994 and 2003. The interannual variation correlates strongly with several measures of EPP activity, including auroral and medium energy electron hemispheric power, and satellite measurements of thermospheric NO. This represents the first estimation of EPP-NOx contributions to the stratospheric odd nitrogen budget using observations over an entire solar cycle. The results will be useful for evaluating and constraining global models to investigate coupling of the upper and lower atmosphere by the EPP IE, including any influences this might have on ozone trends and possibly on climate.		1

A maximum upper tropospheric HCOOH mixing ratio of 3.13 ± 0.02 ppbv (1 ppbv = 10−9 per unit volume), 1 sigma, at 10.5 km altitude was measured during 2004 at 29.97°S latitude and a lower maximum HCOOH mixing ratio of 2.03 ± 0.28 ppbv, at 9.5 km altitude was measured during 2005. Fire counts, back trajectories, and correlations of HCOOH mixing ratios with ACE simultaneous measurements of other fire products confirm the elevated HCOOH mixing ratios originated primarily from tropical fire emissions. A HCOOH emission factor relative to CO of 1.99 ± 1.34 g kg−1 during 2004 in upper tropospheric plumes is inferred from a comparison with lower mixing ratios measured during the same time period assuming HITRAN 2004 spectroscopic parameters.		1

The molecule has been the subject of recent increased interest as a consequence of the so-called mystery of CCl4, the discrepancy between atmospheric observations and reported production and consumption. Surface measurements of CCl4 atmospheric concentrations have declined at a rate almost 3 times lower than its lifetime-limited rate, suggesting persistent atmospheric emissions despite the ban. In this paper, we study CCl4 vertical and zonal distributions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (including the photolytic loss region, 70–20 hPa), its trend, and its stratospheric lifetime using measurements from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), which operated onboard the ENVISAT satellite from 2002 to 2012. Specifically, we use the MIPAS data product generated with Version 7 of the Level 2 algorithm operated by the European Space Agency.\r\n\r\nThe CCl4 zonal means show features typical of long-lived species of anthropogenic origin that are destroyed primarily in the stratosphere, with larger quantities in the troposphere and a monotonic decrease with increasing altitude in the stratosphere. MIPAS CCl4 measurements have been compared with independent measurements from other satellite and balloon-borne remote sounders, showing a good agreement between the different datasets.\r\n\r\nCCl4 trends are calculated as a function of both latitude and altitude. Negative trends of about −10 to −15 pptv decade−1 (−10 to −30 % decade−1) are found at all latitudes in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere region, apart from a region in the southern midlatitudes between 50 and 10 hPa where the trend is positive with values around 5–10 pptv decade−1 (15–20 % decade−1). At the lowest altitudes sounded by MIPAS, we find trends consistent with those determined on the basis of long-term ground-based measurements (−10 to −13 pptv decade−1). For higher altitudes, the trend shows a pronounced asymmetry between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and the magnitude of the decline rate increases with altitude. We use a simplified model assuming tracer–tracer linear correlations to determine CCl4 lifetime in the lower stratosphere. The calculation provides a global average lifetime of 47 (39–61) years, considering CFC-11 as the reference tracer. This value is consistent with the most recent literature result of 44 (36–58) years.		1

For 60°S to 60°N zonal means, the average yearly change in the 0.7 to 0.1 hPa (∼50 to 65 km) region is −27 ± 3 pptv/year, or −0.78 ± 0.08 percent/year. This is consistent with surface abundance decrease rates (about 6 to 7 years earlier) in chlorine source gases. The MLS data confirm that international agreements to reduce global emissions of ozone-depleting industrial gases are leading to global decreases in the total gaseous chlorine burden. Tracking stratospheric HCl variations on a seasonal basis is now possible with MLS data. Inferred stratospheric total chlorine (ClTOT) has a value of 3.60 ppbv at the beginning of 2006, with a (2-sigma) accuracy estimate of 7%; the stratospheric chlorine loading has decreased by about 43 pptv in the 18-month period studied here. We discuss the MLS HCl measurements in the context of other satellite-based HCl data, as well as expectations from surface chlorine data. A mean age of air of ∼ 5.5 years and an age spectrum width of 2 years or less provide a fairly good fit to the ensemble of measurements.		1

Separate chlorine inventories were carried out in five latitude zones (60°–82°N, 30°–60°N, 30°S–30°N, 30°–60°S, and 60°–82°S), averaging the period of February 2004 to January 2005 inclusive, when possible, to deal with seasonal variations. The effect of diurnal variation was avoided by only using measurements taken at local sunset. Mean stratospheric ClTOT values of 3.65 ppbv were determined for both the northern and southern midlatitudes (with an estimated 1σ accuracy of ±0.13 ppbv and a precision of ±0.09 ppbv), accompanied by a slightly lower value in the tropics and slightly higher values at high latitudes. Stratospheric ClTOT profiles in all five latitude zones are nearly linear with a slight positive slope in ppbv/km. Both the observed slopes and pattern of latitudinal variation can be interpreted as evidence of the beginning of a decline in global stratospheric chlorine, which is qualitatively consistent with the mean stratospheric circulation pattern and time lag necessary for transport.		1

The retrieval of HFC-134a (CH2FCF3) from spaceborne measurements had not been carried out prior to this work. Measurements of these species have been supplemented by data from models to extend the altitude range of the profiles and have also been complemented by estimates of 15 minor fluorine species. Using these data, separate fluorine budgets were determined in five latitude zones (60°–82°N, 30°–60°N, 30°S–30°N, 30°–60°S, and 60°–82°S) by averaging over the period of February 2004 to January 2005 inclusive, when possible. Stratospheric FTOT profiles in each latitude zone are nearly linear, with mean stratospheric FTOT values ranging from 2.50 to 2.59 ppbv (with a 1σ precision of 0.04–0.07 ppbv and an estimated accuracy of 0.15 ppbv) for each zone. The highest mean FTOT value occurred in the tropics, which is qualitatively consistent with increasing levels of stratospheric fluorine and the mean stratospheric circulation pattern.		1

The details of this coupling are investigated by using experimental water vapor profiles observed by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) instrument as input to a photochemical model to predict OH profiles for comparison with experimental OH profiles observed by the Optical Spectrograph and Infra-Red Imager System (OSIRIS) instrument. We show that the model OH profiles in the 60 km to 80 km altitude region employing standard reaction rates are in agreement within 15% with the experimental OH profiles over a range of longitudes and local times, whereas the MAHRSI observations indicate the model OH densities in the middle mesosphere are approximately 30% too large. The quality of the OSIRIS OH observations and the ACE-FTS water vapor observations are both sufficiently accurate in the upper mesosphere to yield satisfactory agreement for individual profile comparisons. An example of the hemispheric maps of OH density measured by OSIRIS is shown for an altitude of 80 km.		1

The 1985 to 1994 measurements were recorded from the ATMOS (Atmospheric Trace MOlecule Spectroscopy) instrument at 0.01 cm−1 resolution and in 2004 by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) instrument at 0.02 cm−1 resolution. Stratospheric volume mixing ratios, inferred from a polynomial fit to averages from the time periods considered here, increased from 49.37 ± 2.60 pptv (10−12 per unit volume) in 1985 to 58.38 ± 4.14 pptv in 1992, 60.46 ± 2.97 pptv in 1993, 60.11 ± 3.60 pptv in 1994 and to 70.45 ± 3.40 pptv in 2004. The stratospheric CF4 mixing ratio has continued to increase but at a slower rate than in previous years, for example, (1.14 ± 0.68)% yr−1 in 2004 as compared to (2.77 ± 0.47)% yr−1 in 1985, 1 sigma. Correlations of CF4 with N2O taking into account the increase of N2O with time also show the increase in the stratospheric CF4 burden over the two decade measurement time span. Our space-based measurements show that the slowdown in the rate of CF4 accumulation previously reported from surface measurements through 1997 has propagated to the stratosphere and is continuing.		1

We demonstrate the technique using a 3-D CTM and then apply the technique to OMS tropical balloon observations, UARS CLAES January 1993, and ACE February–March 2005 observations of CFC11, CFC12, CH4, and N2O. Our results using the ACE and OMS data are generally in agreement with mean age of air estimates from the chemical model and from observations of SF6 and CO2; however, the UARS-derived mean age estimates show an intrusion of very young tropical air into the midlatitude stratosphere. The UARS CLAES values of F11 and F12 appear to be significantly higher than ACE and model values and bias our lower-stratospheric estimates of the age derived from UARS data toward younger values.		1

Mixing ratios up to 260 ppbv (10−9 per unit volume) for CO, 1470 pptv (10−12 per unit volume) for HCN, and 1.67 ppbv for C2H6 are observed in the upper troposphere and their variations are highly correlated reflecting their similar lifetimes and emission origin. Back trajectory calculations and maps of fire distributions for the time period indicate the elevated levels likely originated from regions of tropical fire emissions in South America or Africa with cases identified with elevated emissions reaching close to the lower stratosphere.		1

Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) VMRs measured during 2004 have been compared with those obtained in 1985 and 1994 by the Atmospheric Trace MOlecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) instrument. Trends are estimated by referencing the measured VMRs to those of the long-lived constituent N2O to account for variations in the dynamic history of the sampled air masses. Pressure-gridded measurements covering 10–100 hPa (∼16 to 30 km altitude) were used in the analysis that includes typically 25°N–35°N latitude. The VMR changes provide further evidence of the impact of the emission restrictions imposed by the Montreal Protocol and its strengthening amendments and adjustments and are consistent with model predictions and known sources and sinks of halocarbons. Decreases in the lower stratospheric mixing ratios of CCl3F and HCl are measured in 2004 with respect to 1994, providing important confirmation of recent ground-based solar absorption measurements of a decline in inorganic chlorine. Trends estimates are compared with other reported measurements and model predictions.		1

Rinsland	2005	6	Geophysical Research Letters				32	15	L15S08		HCl, ClONO2, Evolution of the atmosphere, Middle atmosphere	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005GL022396		publications/pdfs/Mahieu_et_al-2005-Geophysical_Research_Letters.pdf			10.1029/2005GL022396	f	[1] We report first comparisons of stratospheric column abundances of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) derived from infrared solar spectra recorded in 2004 at selected northern latitudes by the spaceborne Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) instruments at the NDSC (Network for Detection of Stratospheric Change)-affiliated sites of Thule (Greenland), Kiruna (Sweden), Jungfraujoch (Switzerland), and Egbert and Toronto (Canada). Overall, and within the respective uncertainties of the independent measurement approaches, the comparisons show that the ACE-FTS measurements produce very good stratospheric volume mixing ratio profiles. Their internal precision allows to identify characteristic distribution features associated with latitudinal, dynamical, seasonal and chemical changes occurring in the atmosphere.		1

Walker	2005	6	Geophysical Research Letters				32	15	L15S05		N217O, CH3D, 13CH4, N218O, 15NNO, N15NO, CH4, N2O, Middle atmosphere, Mesospheric dynamics, Polar meteorology	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005GL022671		publications/pdfs/Nassar_et_al-2005-Geophysical_Research_Letters_1.pdf			10.1029/2005GL022671	f	[1] Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) solar occultation measurements have been used to create volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles of H2O, CH4, and N2O inside and outside the 2004 Arctic vortex. Using derived meteorological quantities such as potential vorticity, we have classified 450 occultations (from February and March 2004 spanning 0 to 79.8°N) as vortex, vortex edge, or extravortex. We plot [CH4] versus [N2O] correlations to display the distinct patterns observed for measurements of different air masses and use these correlations to further classify the extravortex occultations as tropical, subtropical, or midlatitude. Using comparisons between high latitude profiles of [N2O], [CH4], and [H2O] inside and outside the Arctic vortex, we estimate upper stratospheric and lower mesospheric descent rates and find that descent in the winter 2004 Arctic vortex was rapid, with evidence of descent at higher altitudes than in past years.		1
