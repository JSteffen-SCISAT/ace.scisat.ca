		The ACE-FTS is the main instrument on SCISAT. It is a high spectral 
		resolution (0.02 cm<sup>-1</sup>) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) 
		operating from 2.2 to 13.3 &micro;m (750&#45;4400 cm<sup>-1</sup>) with a 
		Michelson interferometer that was custom designed and built by 
		ABB-Bomem in Quebec City.
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		The interferometer uses two cube corners rotating on a central flex pivot 
		to produce the optical path difference. An &quot;end&quot; mirror inside the 
		interferometer is used to double pass the radiation and increase the 
		optical path difference. The ACE-FTS design is fully compensated for tilt 
		and shear of both moving and stationary optics inside the interferometer. 
		A pointing mirror, controlled by a suntracker servo-loop, locks on the Sun 
		center and tracks it while the instrument is taking measurements.

		The FTS has a circular field of view (FOV) of 1.25 mrad, a mass of about 
		41 kg, and an average power consumption of 37 W. Double-sided interferograms 
		are Fourier transformed on the ground to obtain the desired atmospheric spectra. 
		The FTS uses two photovoltaic detectors (InSb and HgCdTe), aligned with a 
		dichroic element to have the same field of view. The detectors are cooled 
		to 80&#45;100 K by a passive radiator pointing toward deep space.
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		Inside the ACE-FTS instrument is a visible/near infrared imager with two filtered 
		channels at 0.525 and 1.02 &micro;m, chosen to match two of the wavelengths monitored 
		by the SAGE II satellite instrument. The imagers provide an important diagnostic for 
		pointing and for detecting the presence of clouds in the FOV. The detectors in the 
		imagers are filtered CMOS detector arrays, (effectively) 128 &times; 128 active pixel 
		sensors made by Fill Factory of Mechelen, Belgium . The total FOV of the imagers is 30 
		mrad, to be compared to the 9 mrad angular diameter of the Sun. The SNR of each solar 
		image is greater than 1000, but the main image suffers from overlap by weak secondary 
		images from optical filters that were not tipped far enough off the optical axis.
